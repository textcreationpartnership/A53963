            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE kind Acceptance which my former Diſcourſe upon this Subject found at your Graces hands, hath given me Encouragement and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to prefix your great Name to this; which indeed ſhould have been preſented to your Noble Patronage long ago, but that the late Controverſies with the Romaniſts (wherein I thought my ſelf bound to take my ſhare) and a great many unexpected Accidents ſince, have hitherto hindred me from bringing it even to that little Perfection wherein it now appears. Beſides, Madam, the Subject being altogether <hi>Practical and directive of the Conſcience,</hi> a little time was not enough for that Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Care, which a matter of ſuch a tender and weighty Nature muſt require, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially ſince my deſign from the beginning, was, not only to inform Communicants, but moreover to lend ſuch Aſſiſtance to all others,
<pb facs="tcp:48910:3"/>
in order to a right underſtanding of their Duty, as I hoped might ſerve to promote the great Ends of Chriſtianity in general. To this purpoſe, I have ſomewhat largely and particularly diſcourſed of theſe things which concern all ſorts and ranks of Chriſtians, as <hi>Faith, Repentance, Charity,</hi> and <hi>Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;</hi> to which I thought fit to add in the laſt place, a ſhort <hi>Platform of a Chriſtian Life,</hi> collected out of the Holy Scriptures, and digeſted into little, that every one may ſee, as it were at one view, the Nature, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence, and Eaſineſs of that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which the New Covenant exacteth at all our Hands: and all this I reſolved and endeavoured to do in ſuch a plain and clear manner, that I might be ſerviceable to thoſe of the moſt ordinary and vulgar Capacities, becauſe they need Inſtructions moſt of all.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, Madam, that in ſaying this, I ſeem to have made an Objection againſt my ſelf, as to this Dedication; and fear that all thoſe who have the Honour to know your Grace, will be ſtartled to ſee a little Book, intended for ordinary Capacities, preſented to a Perſon of ſuch eminent Parts and Judgment, as well as Quality. But I hope the wonder will ceaſe, when once it is conſidered, that the whole deſign of this Piece being to excite and quicken Men to a ſerious Practice of Religion, I could not but look upon it as your Graces due,
<pb facs="tcp:48910:3"/>
were there no other reaſon but this, that your Grace is a great Example of Virtue and a truly Chriſtian Life in all particulars; which, God be thanked, I can very ſafely affirm and tell the whole World, without the leaſt guilt of Flattery. But beſides, Madam, my Perſonal Obligations to both your Graces, for your great and continual Favours to me and mine, and the tenderneſs you are pleaſed to ſhew us daily, do challenge from me all poſſible Expreſſions of Honour, and dutiful Affection; and all too little, I am ſure; not any thing indeed in compariſon of that Service which I ſhould, and with all my Heart would do, were it in my Power. Among ſome Diſcouragements I have met with in the World, I bleſs God, the great comfort of my life is, that I enjoy ſo plentiful a ſhare of your Graces goodneſs, with all Freedom and Gratitude I acknowledge my ſelf to be in that reſpect, as happy a Man as lives. The Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I am now in, I was unexpectly put into by the deſire of both your Graces, and by your Zealous Applications to ſome great Friends, who could have no other reaſon to conſider me but for the ſake of your Graces, whom they were ready to gratifie for your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch true Friends and Ornaments to our Church, and the whole Proteſtant Religion. Your thus tranſplanting me into your Graces own Neighbourhood, as it was an argument
<pb facs="tcp:48910:4"/>
of the moſt kind Intentions, that I ſhould ſpring and thrive afreſh under the influence of your Favour; ſo is it a mighty Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to my Miniſtry, which is now aſſiſted with ſuch Noble Comments upon Chriſtianity, and Examples of it, as may prove more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perative than any Diſcourſes of mine. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon theſe Accounts, Madam, all the labours I can beſtow, can be but ſo many Expreſſions of Thankfulneſs; which I humbly intreat both your Graces to accept of, being all that I can tender, beſides my earneſt Supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Almighty God, evermore to continue and encreaſe his Goodneſs to your Graces and your Noble Iſſue; and to enrich you with all the Bleſſings of Heaven and Earth; which is, Madam, the daily Affectionate Prayer of</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Of the Neceſſity of Receiving the Holy Sacrament.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THOUGH Notions are for the moſt part more Difficult, and of far leſs Concernment for men to Underſtand, than their Duty; yet ſuch is the general Curioſity of People, that they are more intent upon Speculations, than up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Practice, and ſtudy more to be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of an Opinion, than to inform and keep a good Conſcience.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER, in regard that Knowledge is the Principle of Action, and Men are ſo governed by their Perſwaſions, that their Practice is ever ſuitable to their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, the moſt natural way of prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them to comply with their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is to inſtruct their Underſtandings in the firſt place, and to furniſh them with ſuch Notions as may have a due influence upon them, and do naturally tend to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48910:6"/>
prompt them on to that buſineſs which lyeth before them.</p>
               <p>THIS is the Reaſon, that when I entred upon the Subject of the Holy Sacrament, I thought it adviſable for me to <hi>Divide</hi> my Meditations; ſo that I might firſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch the <hi>Notional</hi> part, which is of the greateſt Difficulty; and then proceed to the <hi>Practical,</hi> which is of the greateſt Uſe.</p>
               <p>PURSUANT to this Deſign, I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly diſcourſed at large of the Nature, of the Ends, of the Dignity, and Uſefulneſs of this weighty Ordinance; which things if Men would but ſeriouſly conſider and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in their Thoughts, they could not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neglect a matter of ſuch importance, without offering violence to their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and acting againſt their own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>BUT there is a great deal of matter yet behind, which immediately and directly ſerveth to engage all of us to diſcharge our Duty in this particular, and alſo to govern us in the diſcharging of it. And the firſt thing that offers it ſelf to our Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is touching that <hi>Neceſſity</hi> which ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon us, to eat of this Bread, and to drink of this Cup.</p>
               <p>NOW in order to our better proceeding upon this Subject, we muſt note, that there is a Twofold Neceſſity which relateth to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48910:6"/>
the matter in hand. 1. Firſt, Some things are <hi>Abſolutely</hi> and <hi>Indiſpenſably</hi> Neceſſary, becauſe they are the fixt and immovable Conditions of the New Covenant, without the performance whereof, Salvation can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be expected by us. So, to Believe in Chriſt, to Mortifie our Luſts, to have a Sanctified Spirit, to be Humble, Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the like; theſe things are <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely</hi> Neceſſary; for without Faith, and Repentance, and entire Holineſs of heart, none of us <hi>can ſee the Lord.</hi> 2. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Some things are Neceſſary <hi>Reſpectively</hi> and upon Suppoſition; that is, ſuppoſing that there is ſome Command for them, though they be not neceſſary in their own Nature, but are required chiefly to try and Exerciſe Mens Obedience: Or ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that they are appointed as certain and effectual <hi>Means,</hi> in order to ſome great and Neceſſary End; and as Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to bring us thoſe Mercies, which our Souls ſtand in need of. Now, when we ſay, 'tis Neceſſary to receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of Chriſts Body and Blood; the meaning is not, that it is abſolutely, ſimply, indiſpenſably, and univerſally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, ſo that no Man can poſſibly be ſaved without it. For no <hi>Rites</hi> whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever are to be accounted of equal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with ſubſtantial Morality; and

things of Poſitive Inſtitution, though they be neceſſary in their Kind and Quality, yet they are not neceſſary in that degree, as thoſe things are which are good in themſelves, and which carry an eternal Reaſon and Obligation along with them. In ſome caſes a Ritual Ordinance may be omitted; and it is not the bare <hi>Omiſſion,</hi> but the wilful Neglect and <hi>Contempt</hi> of it, that is Criminal in God's account. This is evident from the caſe of Circumciſion, which was of old a Seal of the Covenant between God and the Jews. We find in the fourth of <hi>Exodus,</hi> that when <hi>Moſes</hi> wilfully forbore to Circumciſe his Son, the anger of the Lord was ſo kindled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, that <hi>he met him in his Journey, and ſought to kill him;</hi> and as ſome <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Doctors tell us, did actually ſmite him with a ſudden Diſeaſe; and yet we find in the <hi>5th</hi> of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> that afterwards the Jews omitted Circumciſion for many years together in the Wilderneſs: whether it was, becauſe they were then upon their Travel (as ſome think) or becauſe they were not yet mingled with the Heathens, and ſo needed not as yet to be Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed (as others are of opinion) this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that we do not read that God was diſpleaſed with them for not having been
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48910:7"/>
                  <hi>Circumciſed,</hi> though he was often diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with them for their <hi>Infidelity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE ſame thing is obſerved of the Paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid. Selden de Synedr. Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 2.</note> it ſelf; that it was omitted in the Wilderneſs for about forty years together; becauſe the Celebration of it depended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the uſe of Circumciſion, For in order to the due Celebration of the Paſſover, it was neceſſary not only for the Fathers of Families to be Circumciſed themſelves, but moreover for all the Males in their Houſholds to be Circumciſed too, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 48, 49. So that Circumciſion being pretermitted for ſo many years, the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Paſſover did alſo of courſe ceaſe for that time.</p>
               <p>HENCE we may eaſily collect, that things of Poſitive Inſtitution are not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually neceſſary with thoſe Duties which are naturally and eternally good. In like manner, when the Jews were in Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and could not Solemnly preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before God in his Sanctuary, the Law was not executed upon them: As long as they were in thoſe ſad Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, it was their Unhappineſs and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment that they could not go with their Lambs to the Temple, but 'twas not their ſin that they did it not.</p>
               <p>THUS it was with the Jews under the Law, as to things of this Nature; and thus
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48910:8"/>
it is too with People under the Goſpel, as to matters of the <hi>like</hi> Condition. <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> now is neceſſary; yet not ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary as <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Regeneration;</hi> nor muſt we preſume to ſay, that all Perſons who die Unbaptized are everlaſtingly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable: For though it be ſaid St. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. <hi>He that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved;</hi> yet in the next words, Damnation is the Puniſhment of Unbelief only; it is not ſaid, <hi>He that is not Baptized ſhall be Damned.</hi> Baptiſm is indeed the ſtanding and ordinary Means, which we are tied to uſe; but it doth not follow that God ſo tieth up his own hands, that he cannot, by Virtue of his unlimited Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, diſpenſe with a Rite, and ſhew his Mercy at his Pleaſure. 'Tis even thus in the caſe concerning the receiving of <hi>this</hi> bleſſed Sacrament. It is an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Divine Inſtitution, and ſo it is <hi>communiter &amp; ordinariè,</hi> in its <hi>Kind;</hi> and in a general conſtruction neceſſary to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Happineſs. But yet ſome Perſons are not capable, nor in a condition to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare themſelves for it, as Children, and Lunaticks, and the like: Now, in ſuch a caſe, the Rule is, that no man is obliged to act <hi>niſi poſitis omnibus ad agendum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitis,</hi> unleſs there be a ſufficient pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48910:8"/>
of all Qualifications that are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the Action: Or ſome inevitable croſs Accident may unexpectedly happen, ſo that a Man cannot eat that Bread with his Mouth which his Soul longeth after: And in this caſe the Rule is, that no man is bound to Impoſſibilities; nor ſhall any one be condemned for not performing that which is out of his reach and power: Ones caſe may be ſuch, that it may not be in his Power to receive; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to communicate of the outward <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols</hi> is not ſo abſolutely neceſſary, as it is to <hi>Believe</hi> and <hi>Repent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HOWEVER, out of theſe two Caſes, it is very highly neceſſary to receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental Bread and Wine; that is, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing a Man be <hi>capable</hi> of Receiving, ſo that he cannot plead want of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> or want of due <hi>Information;</hi> at leaſt, cannot pretend that he wants <hi>Means</hi> of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtructed: And ſuppoſing that he hath <hi>Occaſions</hi> and <hi>Opportunities</hi> of Receiving, ſo that he cannot plead want of Time or Power (and I am ſure this cannot be our Plea, who have been bred up under the Inſtructions of a moſt indulgent and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident Church) in this caſe (I ſay) the Receiving of the Sacrament is ſo neceſſary, that the neglect of it makes Men very guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48910:9"/>
of Sin, eſpecially if that Neglect be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary and habitual, as indeed it is in very many Profeſſors of Chriſt's Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>THE Sinfulneſs and Danger of this Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence is fairly proveable from the bare Analogy that is between this, and thoſe Sacrifical Banquets of old, eſpecially the Paſchal Feaſt. Such as might celebrate it, and refus'd to do it, were under God's Wrath and Curſe; ſo that if a Man was <hi>clean, and not in a Journy,</hi> and yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore to keep the Paſſover, that <hi>Soul was to be cut off from his People,</hi> Numb. 9. 13. Now if the Sin was ſo great in <hi>that</hi> caſe, where they ſaw nothing but a Figure and a Shadow, it cannot but be far greater in this caſe, where Men have the Body and Subſtance. To be ſure, the Guilt cannot be leſs, in an inſtance that is of a more Noble and Excellent Nature: Nor can we ſuppoſe, that when Chriſt inſtituted a better Ordinance, he ſhould abate of our Duty; or that Mens deſpiſing of ſuch an important, fixt, and permanent Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is not Criminal, when it was ſuch a Sin to diſregard a temporary and vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rite, which our Redeemer did put an end to. But if this Argument be not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, the wickedneſs of Men in this caſe is further demonſtrable, from a threefold
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48910:9"/>
Conſideration. 1. It is a direct Act of Diſobedience againſt Chriſt's plain and peremptory Command. 2. It proceedeth mainly from an evil Conſcience. 3. It is a moſt injurious Sin againſt a Mans own Soul.</p>
               <p n="1">1. IT is a direct Act of Diſobedience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt's plain and peremptory Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Concerning the Inſtitution of this Myſtery, theſe four things are very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable. 1. That the Command about the Celebration of it, is as ſtrict and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial, as any other Law whatſoever, that is about things which are of a <hi>moral</hi> nature, and of Eternal Obligation. <hi>Take and Eat,</hi> ſaith our Lord, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. and <hi>Do this in remembrance of me:</hi> So St. <hi>Luke</hi> delivers it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. Now this runs in as commanding a Style, as that Precept doth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve:</hi> And as the other Precepts run, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. <hi>Thou ſhalt do no Murder, Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery, Thou ſhalt not Steal, Thou ſhalt not bear falſe Witneſs, Honour thy Father and Mother, and, Thou ſhalt love thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as thy ſelf.</hi> I do not here compare Thing with Thing, a Ceremony with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, but one Command with another: And ſeeing all of them are equally as plain and peremptory on the one hand, as they
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48910:10"/>
are on the other, it neceſſarily followeth, that though the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>thing</hi> it ſelf doth not, yet the <hi>Command</hi> doth bind us to Obedience in one point, as well as in the reſt; the Divine Law being Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative, and the Will of God being Obliging in ſmaller, as well as in the more weighty matters. 2. This Command touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our receiving the Bleſſed Sacrament, is one of thoſe <hi>new</hi> Laws which are ſtrictly and properly called <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Precepts. Thoſe Everlaſting Duties of <hi>Godlineſs, Righteouſneſs, and Sobriety,</hi> tho' Chriſt did <hi>Adopt</hi> them, and make them a part of his Law, yet we cannot call them the peculiar Laws of Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe they were enacted and written in Mens hearts from the <hi>Beginning,</hi> and they are common to Chriſtians, and Jews, and Heathens alſo. But the Law touching this Sacrament is perfectly an <hi>Evangelical</hi> Command; and the Obſervation thereof is a direct and immediate Profeſſion of our Diſcipleſhip, and of our Faith in him, and Love to him, who came to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Rites, whereby Jews were diſtinguiſhed from other People; and inſtituted this Solemnity as a foederal Rite of his <hi>own,</hi> to be the outward <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>Cognizance</hi> of a Chriſtian. 3. It is obſervable, that Chriſt gave no <hi>plain</hi> and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48910:10"/>
poſitive Command about this matter, till his <hi>Laſt Supper,</hi> and juſt before the time of his <hi>Departure;</hi> to ſhew unto us (as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath ſomewhere noted) that the Obſervation of this Solemnity, ought to be had in very <hi>Venerable</hi> and <hi>Laſting</hi> Eſteem. Becauſe nothing is more Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to Men, than to remember and value the Injunctions of a <hi>Dying</hi> Friend, whoſe <hi>Laſt</hi> Commands are apt to leave a deep impreſſion upon our Minds, and a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual warmth upon our Affections. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though our Bleſſed Saviour, intended all along to Inſtitute this Ordinance, yet he was pleaſed to <hi>poſt-pone</hi> the Inſtitution of it, and to reſerve it until his <hi>Death,</hi> to put his Church in mind of the vaſt Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of this Myſtery, that ſhe might ſet and Devote her ſelf to the Religious Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of That, which ſhe had Received at the Hands of her <hi>Dying</hi> Lord, as the laſt Requeſt and Pledge of his ſincereſt Love. To which we may add in the <hi>4th</hi> place, That this Myſtery beareth an immediate and near Relation to Chriſt himſelf, becauſe it is the great and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Memorial of his Philanthropy. This Character he himſelf hath ſet upon it, that it is the Annunciation of the moſt Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous Love that he could ſhew unto the World; <hi>This do in remembrance of me.</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:48910:11"/>
Lord! were there not a thouſand other Arguments of his Love to us, from his Nativity to his Croſs? What were all his Sermons, Miracles, Sufferings, but ſo many Declarations and Monuments of his Goodneſs, to perpetuate the Memory thereof to all Ages? And yet, we ſee, he appointed this Ordinance, to be in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of him Chiefly and Principally. Here we do moſt Solemnly Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Incomparable Greatneſs of his Love; we do Publickly own and Declare it; we Proclaim and Publiſh it before God and Man. So that now by all this put together, the Neceſſity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving this Sacrament doth plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. For to deny this Neceſſity, is no other than tacitely to deny, that we are to obſerve Chriſt's Laws; to refuſe Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, is in effect to deny him to be our Lord; it is to caſt off our Livery, and to renounce our Profeſſion; to deſpiſe this Memorial of his Philanthropy, is to render our ſelves the moſt Inſenſate and Unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Wretches, that are as willing to have the Memory of his <hi>Love</hi> Dye, as the <hi>Jews</hi> were to have <hi>Him</hi> Expire upon the Croſs.</p>
               <p>I am ſure, in the Primitive and Pureſt times of Chriſtianity, Men accounted it a great Act of Religion, and a main Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of their Affections to the Holy
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48910:11"/>
Jeſus, to Celebrate this Myſtery very often; nay, they looked upon this Solemnity, as a neceſſary part of their conſtant Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; without which, the reſt of their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices were imperfect and lame. Religion began to be Decrepit and Cold, when the Cuſtom of Receiving a few times in the year, ſtole into the Church of Chriſt. For not only in the Apoſtles time, but for a long time after, Chriſtians were wont to Addreſs themſelves to the Lord's Table, every Lord's day, as evidently appears out of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian, Jerome, Auſtin,</hi> and ſome more of the Ancients; nay, in the Synod at <hi>Antioch,</hi> it was De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed; <hi>That all ſuch, as at any time met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Houſe of God to hear the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſhould be Excommunicated if they ſtayed not to Receive the Holy Communion.</hi> Devotion, which now is, as it were, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd into Smoak, in thoſe times ſhined in a mighty Flame; The Hearts of Men were on fire, and their Zeal was Active and Sprightly in this particular, becauſe they reckoned it a neceſſary piece of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. I confeſs, the Practice of the Church, is not that which maketh a thing Neceſſary: Yet 'tis a fair and ſtrong Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of its Neceſſity, as being a good Comment upon our Lord's Command. The continued Practice of the Church
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48910:12"/>
from the Apoſtles downward, doth ſhew, that the Wiſeſt and moſt Learned among them, did look upon themſelves greatly obliged by the Law of Chriſt, to a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Participation of this Myſtery: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſaid, <hi>Do this, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me,</hi> they concluded themſelves bound to do <hi>it often;</hi> and leſt they ſhould not do it often enough, they did it daily.</p>
               <p>BUT I will not urge the Neceſſity of a daily Communion: Yet this we muſt affirm indefinitely, and in general, that 'tis neceſſary <hi>to Communicate often;</hi> ſo that if nothing be wanting, but a willing and ready Mind, to omit it, is a Sin, a Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt's Law: And if we think the Primitive Chriſtians did it too often, they are infinitely more to be followed yet, than many now a days, who either do it not at all, or at moſt but once or twice a year; and even then it may be queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, whether it be not ſomething elſe beſides the Love of Chriſt, that doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. THUS much may ſuffice to be ſpoken of that Neceſſity, which is grounded upon our Lord's Command. But beſides this, we are to conſider, that the neglect of this Sacrament is Evil, not in it ſelf <hi>only,</hi> but in reſpect of a very Evil <hi>Cauſe,</hi> whence
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48910:12"/>
this ſhameful Neglect cometh; for that cannot well be ſuppoſed to be any other, than ſome lurking Sin and Wickedneſs in Mens Hearts, which makes this Sacrament ſo formidable in their Eyes. Since at this Ordinance, God offereth to Men all the Mercies of the Goſpel, and nothing can hinder the conveyance, but an Impenitent and Wicked Heart on the Recipient's part: Hardly would any Man refuſe ſo great Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, did not his Conſcience tell him, that by Reaſon of his Love of Sin, he may take Poyſon into his Mouth, inſtead of the Bread of Life. It muſt needs be, that the great Contempt of this Sacrament is cauſed, moſtly by ſome root of Bitterneſs that is in Men's Breaſts, which renders the Cup of Bleſſing very unſavoury and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome unto them. The World generally is Evil, and many Love to be ſo, and for that Reaſon they dare not come to the Lord's Table. How elſe comes it to paſs, that they croud many times into the Church in Throngs and Multitudes to Prayer, and eſpecially with itching Ears after a Sermon; when yet we ſee a very ſlender appearance (eſpecially in ſome places) at the Sacrament? Certainly we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude (or miſtruſt at leaſt) that People are <hi>Conſcious</hi> to themſelves, of many Vices which they are fond of, and willingly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48910:13"/>
and indulge themſelves in; and rather than they will forſake <hi>thoſe</hi> Vices, they forbear this Ordinance, becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live Wickedly, and Participate too, without Eating and Drinking their own Damnation. And is not this a moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Crime, to value a few paltry Luſts, above the Body and Blood of Chriſt? And to prefer ſome Senſual and Bruitiſh Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, before thoſe Admirable and Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing Bleſſings which are tendred at the Lord's Table? It was the Sin of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that which greatly kindled the Anger of the Lord againſt them, that they ſlighted the <hi>Manna</hi> (which <hi>David</hi> called <hi>the Food of Angels)</hi> and luſted after the <hi>Fleſhpots of</hi> Egypt, <hi>the Cucumbers, the Melons, the Leeks, the Onions, and the Garlick,</hi> Num. 11. Much more will it be lookt upon as an intolerable Crime in us, if we make light of the greateſt Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings that Heav'n can beſtow (as, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of the Holy Spirit, the Fellowſhip of Chriſt, the Pardon of our Sins, the Peace of our Conſciences, an Aſſurance of a Glorious Immortality, and whatſoever is the Felicity of Bleſſed Souls; I ſay if we ſlight and reject all theſe) out of favour to our Senſitive Appetites, that we may ſtill purſue the Unprofitable Works of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Enjoy the Pleaſures of Sin, which
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48910:13"/>
are both Beaſtly in their Nature, and very ſhort for their continuance. As <hi>Maximus</hi>

                  <hi>Tyrius</hi> (an Heathen Philoſopher) argued, <hi>Who is ſo Mad, ſo Bewitched, ſo Byaſſed by his Affections, that for the love of ſmall and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory Pleaſures, of uncertain Enjoyments, of doubtful Hopes, and queſtionable Proſperities, would not change his Life for a Better, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take himſelf to that which is Solid and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable Happineſs?</hi> Yet of ſuch corrupt and object Spirits are they, who neither Love nor dare to partake of this Covenant Feaſt; Men of ſuch Debaucht Minds and Impure Conſciences, that they prize the moſt fordid Conſiderations, above the Love of God, and a Bleſſed Eternity; like unclean Swine, that contemn the ſweeteſt Repoſe in compariſon of a Dunghill, and a Bed of Mire. Were not Men Earthly, and Senſual, every one wou'd ſtrive to be a Companion at the Altar. 'Tis a Polluted Heart that hindreth Men's approaches; becauſe they that are Wicked, will be Wicked ſtill; and that is a great Reaſon, why the Neglect of this Sacrament is Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, foraſmuch as it proceedeth from a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Cauſe, an Evil and a Rotten <hi>Heart.</hi>

That indeed was an Error, that proceeded from the abundant Piety of thoſe times; and the Reaſon upon which that Cuſtom was grounded, was not ſtrong enough; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we cannot ſuppoſe (whatever St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> did imagine) that when Chriſt ſpake thoſe words, he intended that even thoſe ſhould Communicate who were not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>Preparation,</hi> and conſequently could not eat his Fleſh, nor drink his Blood af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a <hi>due manner.</hi> However, it ſeems moſt manifeſt, that the words do refer to this Sacrament; in a <hi>ſecondary</hi> ſenſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. <hi>Primarily</hi> they mean the eating
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48910:14"/>
of Chriſt's <hi>Spiritual</hi> Fleſh, and the drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his <hi>Spiritual</hi> Blood, and that after a Spiritual <hi>manner;</hi> and this a man may do, though he cannot come to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. All Divines do affirm, that Chriſt may be received Spiritually, when he is not received Sacramentally; meaning, that we may receive vital influences from him (which are his Spiritual Body) though we do not communicate of the Sacred Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and I doubt not but that Children, and young Members of the Church do ſo. But this is no Encouragement for any <hi>Adult</hi> Perſons, who are not under any <hi>Incapacity,</hi> this is no encouragement to ſuch, to deſpiſe or neglect this Ordinance; for to ſuch as theſe, the Receiving of the Sacramental Bread and Wine is the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Means of Receiving Chriſt; without uſing theſe Means, they cannot have any Reaſonable <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of ſo great a Bleſſing, nor ſuch ſolid grounds as others have for their Hopes of Salvation.</p>
               <p>PEOPLE may build their Hopes of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation upon Faith and Repentance, and the like: and the truth is, theſe are the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of our Everlaſting Peace. But yet there are ſeveral things which well deſerve to be conſidered. 1. That the Promiſe of Salvation upon Faith and Repentance doth ſuppoſe, that Men are in the Communion
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48910:15"/>
of the Church, and that they expreſs and ſhew that Communion, by a Regular Uſe of this and all other Religious Ordinances; for every one is obliged to <hi>do This,</hi> as well as to Believe and Reform his life. 2. That Man's Faith and Repentance is very much to be ſuſpected, who Refuſeth to <hi>eat of this Bread, and to drink of this Cup.</hi> For how can the Truth of his Faith appear to himſelf, that doth not own and confeſs Chriſt's Authority over him, by his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to it in this particular? Or, if he believeth this Ordinance to be Neceſſary, and <hi>himſelf</hi> to be obliged to the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of it, then how can the ſincerity of his <hi>Repentance</hi> appear, when he continues in That which he muſt acknowledge to be a ſin? Obedience to the Evangelical Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands is the <hi>only</hi> thing that <hi>Tryes</hi> a man, and ſhews him to be what he really is; and he hardly deſerves the Name of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, that declines a Duty which is ſo eaſie, ſo comfortable, ſo advantageous, to every one that is a Penitent indeed. Suppoſe ſuch a man lay upon his ſick Bed, with a troubled Conſcience, and the terrours of Death about him, I would fain know, how he could ſatisfie himſelf, that he is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert in Truth and Reality, ſeeing he hath lived in a continual Breach and Defiance of Chriſt's Law? 3. But ſuppoſe his Faith
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48910:15"/>
and Repentance be ſuch as is required, yet ſtill 'tis Neceſſary for him to Receive the Holy Communion, becauſe 'tis needful for him to have the <hi>Seal</hi> of that Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which he hath by Faith. We know that <hi>Abraham Believed,</hi> and found favour with God <hi>before</hi> he was Circumciſed; and yet by Circumciſion he was <hi>Aſſured</hi> of God's favour. In like manner, ſuppoſe a <hi>Believer</hi> to be forgiven <hi>before</hi> he comes to the Lord's Table, yet he is <hi>Aſſured</hi> of his forgiveneſs by coming to it; and 'tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for People ever to take that courſe which is moſt for their <hi>Safety</hi> and <hi>Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> Every man is apt to think ſo in <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> Contracts, ſo that though a Deed be drawn, and agreed to, yet they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves not ſure enough, 'till the Wax and the Seal be added. And truly, if <hi>the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Light were as wiſe in their Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the Children of this World are</hi> in <hi>their</hi> kind of Wiſdom, they would think every thing Neceſſary, that helpeth to give them the more and more <hi>Aſſurance.</hi> Now this bleſſed Ordinance hath ſuch an Effect and Tendency; ſo that let a Penitent's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition be never ſo good, an honeſt-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Communicant's is much <hi>better;</hi> his Confidence is better grounded; his Hopes are built upon a ſurer baſis; and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of his heart muſt be ſtronger, and the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48910:16"/>
Peace of his Conſcience muſt be greater, and his Condition muſt needs be every way much ſafer, than <hi>His</hi> can be, who from time to time <hi>Neglecteth ſo great Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> For, in the <hi>Fourth</hi> place, It is upon the due Uſe of God's Ordinances, that he entitleth us to Eternal Life. Though he <hi>be loving unto every man,</hi> and is ready to pardon every true Penitent, yet hath he ſet us our <hi>way,</hi> to obtain our pardon; he hath directed a method and courſe, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to our Salvation; and men muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that method, and take that courſe, if they will be happy. 'Tis not Peoples Fancies that can ſave them; nor muſt they think to Capitulate with Almighty God; or to preſcribe <hi>Him</hi> Conditions; but with all heartineſs and readineſs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thoſe Conditions which he hath preſcribed <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s.</hi> Now this is God's Method, to bring men to Happineſs upon a due Uſe of <hi>Sacraments,</hi> as well as by other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances; and we muſt conclude, that he who requireth thoſe Duties we owe our <hi>Selves</hi> and our <hi>Neighbours,</hi> will alſo (and much rather) exact that Duty we owe his <hi>Son.</hi> In ſhort, men muſt go in God's Way, and follow God's Directions, and then depend upon his Goodneſs and Mercy in ſo doing. If the Jews in the Wilderneſs intend to be healed of their
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48910:16"/>
Wounds, they muſt look upon the <hi>Braſen Serpent.</hi> Indeed God might have made them whole and ſound only by a word from his Mouth; but this was not his <hi>way,</hi> and therefore there was a neceſſity for them to make uſe of the other way that he had ordered them, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. And ſo if <hi>Naaman</hi> will be healed of his Leproſie, he muſt <hi>go down into</hi> Jordan, <hi>and waſh ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times.</hi> Indeed he muttered at the Prophet, becauſe <hi>he did not ſtrike his hand over the place</hi> (as he might have done) and he bragged of <hi>Abana and Pharphar, that they were as good Waters as any Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in Judea</hi> (as perhaps they were) and yet for all this, the Prophet's hand muſt not heal him, nor will all the Rivers of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> do him good, but to <hi>Jordan</hi> he muſt go, or elſe return a Leper, as he went, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5. Why thus it is in the preſent caſe: God hath promiſed to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don all penitent people, and to heal them of their Wounds and Leproſies; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, he hath ſhew'd them whither they muſt go, and what Means they muſt make uſe of; he hath ordered us <hi>to Do This, to Eat of this Bread, and to Drink of this Cup for the remiſſion of ſins;</hi> and we are not to begrudge our Duty, but to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low God's Method and Command, and ſo to expect his Bleſſing. Men muſt not
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48910:17"/>
                  <hi>hold off</hi> and forbear, becauſe God can pardon them without theſe Means; or becauſe ſuch great things are ſpoken of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance;</hi> they muſt not let go Certainties, and truſt to Poſſibilities; nor ſlight any Ordinance, as if it were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary, upon a Preſumption that God's Mercy and Power is All-ſufficient. No, they muſt ſhew their Obedience; and have recourſe to thoſe Means which God hath Appointed: And this is one, and a principal one; <hi>viz.</hi> the Receiving of this Bleſſed Sacrament.</p>

               <p>BUT it is a moſt difficult Matter to Perſwade, eſpecially to Actions that are of a Divine and Spiritual Nature. Though Intereſt be commonly the moſt powerful Rhetorick in the World, and Mens greateſt Intereſt is concern'd in this Caſe, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do not diſcern with their Eyes, either the Advantages that are Received by a Worthy <hi>

one, that he had bought a Farm; another, that he went to make Tryal of his Oxen; a third, that he had Married a Wife, and therefore could not by any means come. 'Tis called a Parable, but if you apply it to the Caſe in hand, it is a plain Hiſtory of the Improvidence and Unthankfulneſs of thoſe, who refuſe to come to the Lord's Supper, and would fain come off hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely, if they could, with ſeveral Excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that ſomething or other doth ſtill hinder them from cloſing with the Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Therefore my <hi>next</hi> Buſineſs muſt be to ſhew, how incompetent and trifling Mens Excuſes are; and I muſt do this the <hi>rather,</hi> becauſe the ſhameful neglect which ſome are Guilty of, is very Miſchievous and Scandalous to others; ſo that they both Judge themſelves Unworthy of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, and (as much as in them lyeth) by their bad Example, do help to draw many more into the ſame Condemnation; and further the hurt of divers precious Souls, for whom the Saviour of the whole World was content and deſirous to Dye.</p>
               <p>IN the Proſecution of this Matter, there are ſeveral ſorts of People, I am to ſpeak to. 1. Such <hi>as Indulge</hi> themſelves in a courſe of Life, that is unbecoming and inconſiſtent with Chriſtianity; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are very backward and <hi>unwilling</hi> to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48910:19"/>
come to the Holy Communion. 2. Such as live Honeſtly and Fairly before Men, but yet are ſuch Drudges to the World, and ſo intent upon making Proviſion for their Families, that their whole time is laid out upon Secular Affairs, and they have none left them (as they ſay) for the buſineſs of Preparation; and therefore pretend, they have no <hi>Leiſure</hi> to come. 3. Such as are willing (and perhaps deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous) to Communicate, and confeſs they have time enough to fit themſelves by Prayer, Faſting, and Repentance, but yet what out of a Senſe of their manifold Failings, and what out of an apprehenſion of the greatneſs of the Myſtery, and what out of a miſtruſt of themſelves for the <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> conceive themſelves to be Unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and Unfit, and therefore are <hi>affraid</hi> to come.</p>
               <p n="1">1. NOW, as for thoſe in the firſt place, who make no Conſcience of their ways, but live without having a due regard to the Laws of Religion, I muſt premiſe, that though it be a wonder, that any who have Learned Chriſt (who have heard of his Sufferings, of his Laws, and of his Threats) ſhould preſume in ſpight of all to live after this rate, yet it is no wonder that they who do live ſo, ſhould be back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and unwilling to Receive this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48910:20"/>
It would be very dangerous for them indeed to receive it, becauſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath declared, that he who eateth and drinketh Unworthily, eateth and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Judgment to himſelf; and ſuch Men as I now ſpeak of, are no more Worthy to eat and drink at the Lord's Table, than Swine are fit to live of the Altar. To ſuch, the Holy Sacrament is a dreadful thing indeed, as long as they continue in an Evil Courſe: They do in a manner drink down Death with the Wine, and ſwallow the Bread and the Devil toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Therefore as long as they are in Love with Sin, and Obey it in the Luſts thereof, and yield their Members as Inſtruments of Unrighteouſneſs, they muſt by all means forbear coming to this Ordinance.</p>
               <p>BUT then they muſt obſerve, that this forbearing or refraining upon the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of an Evil Conſcience, will be in no wiſe excuſable in the Great and Terrible day of God; and if any Man be ſo Vain and Fooliſh as to think ſo, I would offer theſe following things to his moſt ſerious Conſideration. 1. That by parity of Reaſon, he may neglect every <hi>other</hi> Divine Ordinance, as well as <hi>this;</hi> for there is none, but what will riſe up in Judgment againſt him, unleſs he Repent, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48910:20"/>
the great Ends of its Inſtitution. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the Wicked, God ſaith, why doſt thou Preach my Law, and takeſt my Covenant into thy mouth, ſeeing thou hateſt to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed? Pſ.</hi> 50. 16, 17. In like manner, why do ſuch Men call upon God's Name, or pleaſe themſelves, that they hear his word? Nay, why indeed do they profeſs themſelves Chriſtians, as long as they hate to be Reformed? For the Diſpleaſure of God is provoked throughout, and God is their Enemy, and they are His, as long as they thus continue in Sin. For all that ſuch Men do, is Leavened with Hypocriſie; and no Monſter is ſo hateful to God and Man, as an Hypocrite. He that Prayeth with his Mouth, and hath Villany in his Heart, doth in a manner ſpit in God's Face. He that Heareth the Divine Oracles with an Uncircumciſed Ear, doth but make a Mockery of Religion: And he that own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf a Diſciple of Chriſt, and at the ſame time is a Son of <hi>Belial,</hi> infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affronteth the Son of God, by making him a Friend to Immorality and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. 'Tis an <hi>Honeſt</hi> and Upright Heart that rendreth all our Services acceptable; and where that is wanting, the Sinner may as well forbear every Exteriour Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Religion; as go from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; there is the ſame Reaſon for both,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48910:21"/>
becauſe he injureth himſelf, and draweth a Curſe and Judgment upon his Head in other Inſtances, as well as by eating and drinking Unworthily. 2. To refuſe the Communion, is ſo far from <hi>Extenuating,</hi> that it aggravates the Crimes of an Evil Wretch; becauſe he thereby addeth one Sin to another; and this is the plain Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of his Heart; I have broken the reſt of God's Commandments, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will go on and break this too. Now I would beſeech ſuch to conſider, whether this doth not tend to their greater <hi>Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> inſtead of amounting to a juſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe. For a Man to ſhed his Neighbour's Blood, and then to plead that he had Malice in his Heart, is the ready way not to leſſen, but to heighten his Offence; and ſo, for a Man to trample under foot the Blood of Chriſt (as they in ſome Senſe do, that ſlight and vilifie this Ordinance) and then to pretend in his excuſe, that he was an Impenitent Sinner, is to be Guilty in ſome meaſure, of the Sin of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they Crucified the Saviour of the World, becauſe he upbraided them with their Incorrigibleneſs. Were Men allowed to come to the Sacrament with their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties about them, we ſhould have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants enough; but becauſe this Holy Rite is an Adverſary to their Luſts, and is
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48910:21"/>
intended to bring Men under the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the New Law; Therefore ſuch as are Wicked, and reſolve to be ſo, draw back, and keep themſelves off at a great diſtance from it, leſt they ſhould be put to the trouble of Repenting; and then they make that their <hi>Apology,</hi> which in Truth is their <hi>Crime, viz;</hi> that they are in a very ill State. A thing, which, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being any tolerable Plea, is a moſt inexcuſable Pretence; Becauſe, <hi>3dly,</hi> it is a Brutiſh and Unreaſonable Contempt of that, which is a certain Remedy (if duly uſed) againſt the greateſt Evil; and for that very Reaſon, do Licentious Men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it, becauſe it is a Remedy. Now who would pity a Man, that will not go to the Fire becauſe he is ready to ſtarve with Cold, or that refuſeth to eat for that very Reaſon, becauſe he is ready to ſtarve with Hunger? Why, ſuch is the contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macious Folly of thoſe, who contemn God's Pardon at the Sacrament, becauſe they need it; and refuſe to be cleanſed by the Fountain of Life, becauſe they are Filthy; and reject the means of Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, becauſe they are in a State of Death. In this caſe, every Refractory Perſon pleadeth his Diſeaſe, to excuſe his Unwillingneſs to accept of Help: Such an upardonable Act of Stubborneſs; as if a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48910:22"/>
Man ſhould ſay, he is in extremity of Sickneſs, and therefore he will not make uſe of a Phyſician. 'Tis true, moſt do pretend, that it is not out of Contempt, but out of Reverence, that they dare not approach to the Holy Table; they have a dread upon them, and are <hi>afraid</hi> (as they ſay) of incurring God's Diſpleaſure, and of Damning their own Souls, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Unworthily. But then I would intreat them to ask their Conſciences, why and how it comes about, that they are not afraid to <hi>Sin?</hi> And why they are not afraid to Tranſgreſs other Divine Laws, as well as to Violate this? Are Men ſo Fooliſh, as to think, that there is only one Path which leadeth to Hell? and that nothing will bring them to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, but Unworthy Receiving? Or that they may Sin ſafely, as long as they Sin, and do not Eat? There is every whit as much danger by an Evil Courſe of Life, as by undue Participation; and a Man may drink his own <hi>Damnation</hi> at a <hi>Tavern,</hi> or in his own Houſe, as well as at the Lord's Table; ſo that when he dreadeth to do that, which he is commanded to do often, he ſhould examine the Reaſon, why he dreads not that which he is required never to do. 4. It is not the ſtaying from the Sacrament that will ſerve an Ill Man's
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48910:22"/>
turn; it is an addition to his Guilt, but no diminution of his Wickedneſs; and whether he Communicate or forbear, his Caſe is very bad, till he makes his Peace with God, by a ſincere Repentance, and Reformation of his Life. Into ſuch a wretched ſtrait and Snare, do Ungodly and Irreligious Courſes draw Men, that whether they Receive the Sacrament or no, they are Miſerable; they Periſh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Holy Food, and they Periſh by Eating it too; ſo that they have only this one way left them to ſecure them from final Ruine, <hi>viz.</hi> to Repent them ſeriouſly of all their Wickedneſs, and ſo to Eat of this Bread, and to Drink of this Cup. What (ſay they) would you have us be Damned, by Receiving the Sacrament, when we are not in a fit Condition for it? No; but we would have you fit your ſelves, and then Receive: We would have you neglect neither, but do both; becauſe your Unfitneſs is no Excuſe or Bar againſt your Duty, by Reaſon that your Unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is wilful; and your failure in one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, cannot excuſe, but muſt needs aggravate your failure in another. He that Eateth Unworthily, is Guilty in Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe he <hi>Profaneth</hi> Chriſt's Body: And he that Eateth not at all, is Guilty in not Eating, becauſe he <hi>Deſpiſeth</hi> Chriſt's
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48910:23"/>
Body. And thus much of thoſe that neglect the Communion through an Evil Conſcience.</p>
               <p n="2">2. THERE is another ſort of Men that are Guilty of the ſame Crime, but upon different Reaſons (at leaſt they pretend ſo) ſuch as paſs for Fair and Juſt Men, but yet are ſo intangled with the Cares of the World, that they excuſe their abſence from the Sacrament, by pleading that they want time: As if they Lived in ſome ſtrange and unknown Country, where there are not any hours in the day.</p>
               <p>NOW as to Matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> there is no queſtion, but that Secular Concernments do hinder many from this and other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Religion; upon which account, it is the prime Duty of a Chriſtian to Dye unto the World; and ſo much Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated, when dividing his Benedictions, he Bleſſed thoſe in the <hi>firſt</hi> place, who are <hi>Poor in Spirit,</hi> as you find by thoſe Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts who have recorded his Sermon on the Mount; and the Reaſon of it is told us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 24. becauſe we cannot ſerve God and Mammon too: And we ſee it by every days Experience, that the Love of Greatneſs and Riches, and the Inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Cares of this Life, are apt to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh all other Conſiderations. But then if we ſpeak <hi>de Jure,</hi> of the Reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48910:23"/>
and Sufficiency of their Excuſes, who time after time refuſe the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, under a pretence, that they have not leiſure to Prepare themſelves for it; there are many Conſiderations to be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which ſhew, that this Plea will rather Condemn than Acquit them; for Brevity ſake, I ſhall pitch upon theſe. 1. That this Plea is very much to be ſuſpected and queſtion'd, whether it be real, or only a Pretext and a Cloak to cover their Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. 2. But ſuppoſe, that they are Men of ſome Ingenuity, who pretend variety or multiplicity of Buſineſs, Men that are Honeſt and Conſcientious in their Callings, but yet are carried away with an hurry of Affairs, and are <hi>troubled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout many things,</hi> as was ſaid of <hi>Martha, Luke</hi> 10. 41. yet they ſhould often call to mind the next words of our Saviour, that <hi>one thing is needful.</hi> It is not neceſſary to be Rich, but 'tis neceſſary to be Religious; and Worldly Matters muſt ever give place to things that are of an Heavenly and Spiritual Nature, when they ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Competition. Men were better do, as <hi>Crates</hi> the <hi>Theban</hi> did, part with all their Gold, than be void of that which is true Wiſdom: And it is infinitely more deſirable for them to be <hi>rid</hi> of thoſe Riches which are a clog unto them, and hinder
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48910:24"/>
them from going to Heaven, than upon their Death-Beds to be troubled with a ſad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, that they have been more faithful Drudges to their Familes, than Friends and Servants to God. 3. But I hope there are many good People who uſe the World, yet neither Abuſe the World, nor themſelves for the World's ſake. I am ſure, 'tis poſſible to have our Converſation in Heaven, even while we live upon the Earth; and 'tis no difficult Matter for a Wiſe Man, to ſerve God and himſelf too. Let him follow his Vocation diligently, let him deal Juſtly, and ſhew Mercy, and walk Humbly, and Pray Daily, and with a good Conſcience; and then in doing the works of his Calling, he doth in ſome meaſure work out his Salvation too. For he Obeyeth God in labouring with his hands, and in working that which is good; and ſo throughout the week, he doth in ſome ſort and degree fit and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himſelf againſt the Sacrament on the Lord's day. I deny not, but Men ſhould pare off ſome portion of the ſix days, and Conſecrate it to a more ſolemn and ſtrict Preparation. Yet this I ſay, that the following of our Secular Buſineſs with So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety and Honeſty, is far from being a juſt hinderance, to keep him from attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on this Ordinance. For let a Man
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48910:24"/>
but lead an Holy Life (and that he may do in any Calling that is but lawful) and the leſs time will be required for ſelf Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. Let him but carry always the true Fear of God in his Heart, and the leſs fearful will he be of drawing near unto God in the Church, becauſe he never departeth from him, though he be at home. An upright Converſation is a continual Prayer, and a conſtant kind of Preparation; and ſo Men may in ſome meaſure fit themſelves to be Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants, even in their Shops and Ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes. And yet certainly the Buſineſs of the day is not ſo great nor urgent, but that any the moſt painful Tradeſman may find ſome convenient time, to offer up to God the <hi>Morning and Evening Sacrifice,</hi> both of Praiſe for the Enjoyment of his Mercies, and of Prayer for the Pardon of his own Sins. Now let him but enter upon his Affairs with Devotion, and mannage them with Integrity, and end them and the day with Piety and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for his Failings, and he may be fit to Communicate weekly if he will. And if any Man be ſuch an Enemy to himſelf, as that he is careleſs in obſerving this Method, let him lay the blame not upon the Urgency of his Buſineſs, or want of time, but (where it ſhould be laid) upon
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48910:25"/>
his want of true Zeal, and a right Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Spirit. Yet it is not to be denied, but Men may have ſome more extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Troubles come in upon them at ſome times, than at others. Such is the courſe of this world, that there are floods as well as ebbings of Buſineſs in every Employment. However, <hi>4thly,</hi> This is to be Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the moſt important Matters are rarely ſo inſtant and preſſing, but Men can pick out ſome lucid intervals, and ſteal away from their Cares, either to ſome by-Concernments that are not ſo cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, or to Recreations that are for their Refreſhment. And how can Men pretend, that they have not time to fit themſelves for the Sacrament, when they may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch the work in a leſs ſpace, than that amounts to, which many times is vainly, and ſometimes ſinfully employed? If ſuch Men were ſure to purchaſe an Eſtate, by the Prayers and Penances of a week, I am apt to think, none of them would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that they wanted time. Or if an Office or Place were in danger to be loſt, or a conſiderable ſumm of Mony like to be forfeited, unleſs the Sacrament be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by ſuch a day, 'tis likely that whatever Mens Buſineſs or Concerments are, they would be ſure to keep their ſides free from the laſh of the Law. And

what's the Reaſon, that Penal Statutes are ſo carefully obſerved, while at other times the Commands of Chriſt are ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſt over, but that Men generally have not that tender regard of their Souls, as they have of their Purſes, and of their Secular Intereſt?</p>
               <p n="3">3. BUT beſides theſe, there is a third ſort of Perſons, whoſe Excuſes are a little to be Conſidered too; many Serious, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, and Devout Chriſtians, I doubt not, who have both Hearts to come to the Communion, and time enough for Preparation, but yet are troubled with Scruples and Fears, leſt they ſhould not come prepared ſufficiently, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Pious Endeavours; and ſo rather chuſe to refrain, though it be with much reluctancy and regret. Theſe Fears and Scruples, I now ſpeak of, do moſtly, if not altogether, proceed from wrong No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Apprehenſions concerning this Myſtery. Becauſe they are told, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they Receive, they muſt Examine themſelves, whether they be in a State of Grace; and that after they have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, they muſt be careful continually to perſevere in that State; hence it cometh to paſs, that they are very miſtruſtful of themſelves, and very fearful of the worſt. Perhaps the remembrance of ſome Sin
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48910:26"/>
that is paſt, doth yet run in their minds, though they be truly Penitent for it; and withal the Senſe of their Natural Weakneſs makes them doubtful for the future, leſt they ſhould Tranſgreſs again notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their watchfulneſs; and the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of what is paſt, and of what may follow, diſquiets their Conſciences; and thinking to Err on the Right Hand, they reſolve to keep their feet from the Table of the Lord, leſt they ſhould take a ſtep towards the brink of Deſtruction.</p>
               <p>NOW, to rectifie the miſtakes of theſe, it is to be obſerved, That no more is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of any (in point of Practice) for the due Receiving of this Sacrament, than what is required of us all by the Tenor of the New Covenant; for here we do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new our Covenant with God, and engage our ſelves afreſh, but upon the <hi>former</hi> Terms that were undertaken at our Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm: So that what that Covenant doth contain, that we are bound now to make good. Now the Conditions of the New Covenant are theſe in ſhort, <hi>viz.</hi> Faith in Chriſt, accompanied with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance from all dead Works. And if Men bewail their Sins heartily, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to be circumſpect for the time to come, not allowing themſelves in any thing that is Evil, but forſaking all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48910:26"/>
Habits, and watching againſt all ſinful Acts; and if they perſevere in this courſe, ſtudying to ſerve God according to the beſt of their Power and Knowledge; there is no doubt, but they ſhall find acceptance with God. And theſe are the things which we profeſs at the Sacrament, that we do and will do: 1. We profeſs our ſelves Penitents for all that is paſt and gone. 2. We undertake to live Godly Lives for the future; meaning as near as we can, by the help of God's Grace, conſidering the Imperfections of our Depraved Nature. And if we do not Profeſs and undertake theſe things at other times, we are not ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as Chriſtians; and if we do them ſincerely now, we are fit to be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants. So that, I confeſs, I do not ſee, what Reaſon any Conſcientious and Good Hearted Man hath to be afraid of this Ordinance; rather it ſhould be his Comfort and Joy, that he hath liberty to uſe it; becauſe it is the Seal of thoſe Promiſes of Pardon and Mercy, which God hath made to every broken Heart. No ſcruples therefore are ſufficient to beat off any Pious and Penitent Souls; for if Men do not Repent and Reform, they are not the Diſciples of Chriſt; and if they do, they are in a good Condition to be
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48910:27"/>
Gueſts at Chriſt's Table. I have more to ſay concerning this matter, when I come to treat of the Nature of that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration which is neceſſary; but this I hope is ſufficient for the preſent.</p>

               <p>THE Neceſſity of Receiving the Holy Sacrament being thus proved, it is time now to conſider thoſe <hi>Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and <hi>Preparations</hi> wherewith all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are bound to come to the Lord's Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that they may Eat and Drink aftr a worthy manner.</p>
               <p>AND here, two things are to be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into, for the full ſatisfaction of Mens Conſciences. 1. Firſt, concerning the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of Preparing our ſelves before hand; how that doth <hi>appear.</hi> 2. Secondly, concerning the <hi>Nature</hi> of this Preparation; wherein that doth <hi>conſiſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. FIRST, touching the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of Preparing our ſelves, before we preſume <hi>to eat of this Bread and to drink of this Cup.</hi> It is obſervable, That our Bleſſed Saviour
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48910:27"/>
himſelf gave his Diſciples no particular Inſtructions about this matter, when he Inſtituted this Solemnity. He command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them indeed <hi>to do this,</hi> and to Celebrate this Myſtery <hi>in Remembrance</hi> of him; but we do not Read of any expreſs Directions he gave, touching <hi>Preparation</hi> thereunto. However, that no Man may be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened to uſe this Ordinance, after an Irreligious or raſh manner, the Neceſſity of Preparing our ſelves, will evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from theſe following Conſiderations. 1. From the conſideration of that <hi>Analogy</hi> which this Myſtery bears to thoſe Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Sacrfical Feaſts,</hi> that were Celebrated by all Mankind. Theſe I have treated of at large, becauſe the full Knowledge thereof, is very ſerviceable in helping us, to underſtand both the Nature of this Feaſt, and our own <hi>Duty</hi> too in the uſe of it; which probably might be the Reaſon of our Lord's Silence in this point: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was not ſo very neceſſary for him to give particular Inſtructions in a matter, which was ſo obvious to all, that Men could eaſily be led to a Senſe of their Duty by thoſe common Notions and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, which both <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> had of Banquets of this Nature.</p>
               <p>AS for the <hi>Heathen</hi> part of the world, they ſaw by the Light of Nature, that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48910:28"/>
Holy things ought to be uſed with a great deal of Reverence, and by Men of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Purity. And for this Reaſon their conſtant Cuſtom was, before they went to their Sacrifical Banquets, to Prepare themſelves with many previous Rites and Ceremonies, ſuppoſing, that thereby they did Sanctifie and fit themſelves for the Service of their Deities. Thus the Pagan Prieſts were wont <hi>to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the very touching of</hi>

They abſtained for many days before hand from Eating of Fleſh, and from Drinking of Wine. They refrained from the Nuptial Bed, and from all Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Pleaſures, uſing many Artificial Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, to ſubdue and Mortifie their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Appetites. And when the time for Sacrificing was come, they arrayed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with clean and ſpotleſs Garments, which they called their <hi>Holy and Religious Dreſs.</hi> Nor was this the Practice of the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48910:28"/>
                  <hi>Prieſts</hi> only. For all the <hi>People</hi> that were to Eat and Drink before their Deities, were required alſo to <hi>Prepare</hi> and <hi>Purifie</hi> themſelves throughly after their way; believing that the outward Sanctifications of their Bodies, did ſerve to Sanctifie and Cleanſe their very Souls and Spirits. Thus <hi>they</hi> were wont to <hi>waſh</hi> themſelves often; to give themſelves to Faſtings and much Abſtinence; to deny themſelves thoſe Fleſhly Satisfactions, which at other times were lawful. Their Cuſtom too, was to make ſolemn acknowledgments of the Sins of their Lives, Praying to their Gods not to take Vengeance upon them. If any Man had his Hands Defiled with Blood, or was polluted and ſtained with any groſs Wickedneſs, he was not to come to the Altar: And when their Services were <note place="margin">See the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors above mentioned.</note> beginning, Proclamation was made, <gap reason="foreign">

AND as touching the <hi>Jews,</hi> every one knows how ſtrictly they were command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Cleanſe</hi> and <hi>Purifie</hi> themſelves, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Sanctifications of the Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they preſumed to Eat and Drink before the Holy One of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at the <hi>Paſchal</hi> Supper, in lieu whereof this <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Solemnity is ſubſtituted and appointed: No Man was permitted to partake of the Paſſover, that was not duly Prepared for it by the Rite of <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion.</hi> No Proſelyte was ſuffered to come, that was not firſt Sanctified and fitted for it, according as the Law directed in that caſe. None that were in their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, or in any reſpect legally Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, whether Men or Women, were to be admitted, till they were cleanſed from their Pollutions. Nay, not the <hi>People</hi> themſelves only, but their very <hi>Houſes</hi> alſo were to be free from all defilements. And hence it was, that ſome days before the Feaſt, they purged all manner of <hi>Leaven</hi> out of their <hi>Rooms;</hi> and for fear any ferment ſhould remain in any part of their dwellings, they were wont, the Night before the Paſſover, to ſearch with a Candle into every hole in their walls, and into every chink and creviſe in their Floors. And whatſoever Leaven was found, their Cuſtom was to burn it, uſing
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48910:29"/>
this Form of words, <hi>Let all the Leaven, and every Leavened thing that is with me,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Buxtorf. Synag. <hi>cap.</hi> 12.</note> 
                  <hi>whether I have ſeen or not ſeen it, whether I have carryed it forth or no, be diſſipated and deſtroyed, and accounted as the duſt of the Earth:</hi> By which Solemn way of Imprecation, the <hi>Jews</hi> did clear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of Guilt, and proteſted their Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to the utmoſt of their Knowledge. And when the Hour was come for the Eating of the Paſſover, before they ſat down, the <hi>Feet</hi> of the Commmunicants were <hi>waſhed,</hi> as at other Feaſts; only it is to be Noted, that at <hi>this</hi> Banquet they waſhed <hi>twice,</hi> to ſhew the <hi>Preeminence,</hi> and great <hi>Dignity</hi> of this Religious Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity above the reſt.</p>
               <p>SEEING then this was the general Practice of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> both, it abundantly argues it to have been the common Senſe of all Mankind, that great and ſtrict Preparations were neceſſary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they durſt preſent any Sacrifice unto God, or Feaſt together upon any parts thereof. And the Correſpondence that is between <hi>this,</hi> and other Ancient <hi>Sacrifical Banquets,</hi> is enough to ſhew how Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and ſtrict the care of Chriſtians ought to be, in preparing and fitting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for ſo Solemn an Ordinance, before they preſume to addreſs themſelves to the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48910:30"/>
Holy Table, to Feaſt together upon a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed Saviour, the Spotleſs <hi>Lamb of God which taketh away the Sins of the world.</hi> For this is a Feaſt of the Higheſt and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt Nature, that ever was. We have an <hi>Altar,</hi> whereof, neither <hi>Heathen</hi> nor <hi>Jew, hath any right to Eat:</hi> And we have a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to partake of, which is infinitely <hi>better than thouſand of Rams, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Rivers of Oyl.</hi> For here we feed on the Son of God himſelf, Chriſt our Paſſover, that was Sacrificed for us, whoſe <hi>Fleſh is Meat indeed, and whoſe Blood is Drink indeed.</hi> Here we enter into a cloſe <hi>Alliance</hi> with the Holy One of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> we are <hi>One</hi> with Chriſt by his <hi>Spiritual Body</hi> that is given us; we Receive the Seals of our <hi>Adoption,</hi> and are poſſeſt of a Title to the Kingdom of Heaven. And this being the Higheſt Myſtery of our Religion, we muſt not dare to Celebrate it after a rude and raſh manner; but come unto it after great Preparations, having firſt ſearched into our State, and meaſured our ſelves by the line of the Goſpel, according to which we ſhall be Judged in the Great and Terrible day; and ſo preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves before the Holy Table, with clean Hands and a Pure Heart, and with Souls full of God, and in Love with all manner of Piety and Goodneſs. Thoſe
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48910:30"/>
Ceremonial Rites, which were made ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Preparatives in order to a due Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of the <hi>Paſchal</hi> Feaſt, were of <hi>Myſtical</hi> ſignification; pointing out that <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> Purity, which is now required of thoſe that enter into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God, by taking the Pledges of his Covenant into their Mouths. They muſt Circumciſe their <hi>Hearts,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> did their <hi>Fleſh:</hi> They ſhould Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their <hi>Souls</hi> and <hi>Conſciences,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> did their <hi>Chambers:</hi> They ſhould keep the Feaſt, not with the <hi>Old Leaven, neither with the Leaven of Malice and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, but with the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleavened Bread of Sincerity and Truth:</hi> They ſhould purge and Sanctifie their <hi>Affections,</hi> as <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> were wont to waſh their <hi>Hands</hi> and <hi>Feet;</hi> and ſo compaſs the Altar of God, having firſt cleanſed their Bodies and Spirits in Innocence. Theſe are the <hi>Moral</hi> Duties, which thoſe Ritual Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances did ſignifie, and which were the ſubſtance and <hi>inſide</hi> of them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perhaps it was, that our Saviour deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered no particular Rules (that we Read of) about this matter; becauſe thoſe Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifications which were every where in the world, uſed in order to a right Participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sacrifical Feaſts, did plainly Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to all Chriſtians what their Duty
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48910:31"/>
was; and did ſpeak enough to inform us all, that we ought to be Religiouſly <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, Prepared,</hi> and <hi>Diſpoſed,</hi> before we approach unto his Table; and thus much he ſeems to have <hi>intimated,</hi> when he <hi>waſhed his Diſciples feet with his own hands,</hi> before he proceeded to the Inſtitution of this Solemnity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. NOW though this be ſufficient to ſhew the Neceſſity of due Preparation in order to a Worthy Receiving of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, yet for further proof hereof, we are, in the next place, to add theſe words of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28. <hi>Let a Man Examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup.</hi> There is not a Text in all the Scriptures, but this only, which gives us a <hi>Command</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> concerning this thing. But this is full and comprehenſive, if we underſtand it in its juſt Latitude, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is the word in the Original Greek, and it ſignifies two things. 1. Firſt, it imports <hi>ſearching</hi> and <hi>trying;</hi> every one ſhould look into his Breaſt, and ſee how his Heart ſtands affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diſpoſed, before he goes to the Holy <hi>Communion.</hi> Seldom is a Man ſo well acquainted with himſelf, but that he hath often Reaſon (eſpecially before he draws near to God, to Contract for an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity) to ask his Conſcience ſeriouſly,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48910:31"/>
                  <hi>Is there not any Wickedneſs in me?</hi> The great Sages of Old thought it one of the moſt difficult matters, for a Man to know himſelf throughly. For ſuch is the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of our Nature, that we are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly very loath to ſearch into our Boſoms, for fear we ſhould diſcover ſome ugly Monſter there, like ill Husbands that are afraid to look over the Account of their Debts, leſt their minds ſhould be diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the ſight of them. And when we do take our ſelves to task, ſuch is our <hi>Partiality,</hi> that for the moſt part we paſs too <hi>favourable</hi> Judgment in our own Caſe, and are apt to think our ſelves Clean, though our Defilements are more than <hi>the ſpots of the Sun.</hi> Conſidering therefore that at this Sacrament we preſent our ſelves, before that Great God who is the <hi>ſearcher of the Reins,</hi> and the <hi>Rewarder of all Evil,</hi> we are very highly concern'd to rip open our Hearts before hand, and to Examine every Angle of our Souls, leſt we receive the ſame Anſwer, which that rude Gueſt received. who came Unprepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Wedding Feaſt, <hi>Friend, how cameſt thou hither, Matth.</hi> 22. <hi>Indeed it would be</hi> needful for us, were we not Chriſtians, but Men only, to caſt our Eyes back upon our ways every Night, and ſee how we have paſs'd over the Hours

So reckoning up the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral paſſages of our Life from the firſt dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Light,</hi> as ſaith <hi>Pythagoras.</hi> For as <hi>Hierocles</hi> hath rightly Noted, <hi>This</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Hyerocl. <hi>in</hi> Pythag. <hi>pag.</hi> 210.</note> 
                  <hi>courſe will ſerve very much, either to Crown us with Joy, for what we have done well; or to increaſe our Repentance for whatever hath been done amiſs.</hi> But never ſhould we be more careful of this, than when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to make our Approaches to the Table of the Lord; then it is moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to lay aſide ſome portion of time, to enquire into our Condition with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, to peruſe the Regiſter of our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and to call our ſelves to an account even for our words and thoughts. For hardly doth any Man walk ſo in this world, but that he contracteth ſome filth daily; ſome Defilements or other are apt to ſtick to his Heels. Even the Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious mannagement of our common Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and our Lawful Callings, though it
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48910:32"/>
be in its kind a good Preſervative againſt Sin, yet 'tis apt to ſteal away our Hearts from God, and to draw us ſometimes into a Snare. And for this Reaſon, the moſt Righteous Man among us hath need to ſequeſter ſome hours from other Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, and to enquire whether he be fit to come to the Supper of the Lamb.</p>
               <p n="2">2. BUT then, Secondly, we muſt note, that this Examination is not required for it <hi>ſelf,</hi> but as a <hi>Relative</hi> Duty, that is. an Excellent <hi>Means</hi> to a farther <hi>end;</hi> that a Man may be able after Tryal and ſearch, to make right <hi>Judgment</hi> of himſelf; and may be provoked and perſwaded to <hi>Correct</hi> the ſeveral <hi>Errata</hi> of his Life. And this is the <hi>full</hi> meaning of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in that place; where he doth chide the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for their ſhameful Miſcarriages in the Church at the Communion time. For <hi>firſt of all, when ye come together in the Church, I hear that there be Diviſions among you,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>v.</hi> 18. And then, <hi>in Eating every one taketh before other his own Supper, and one is Hungry, and another is drunken,</hi> v. 21. Theſe were Vile and Scandalous Actions; and when the Apoſtle Commanded, them to <hi>Examine</hi> themſelves, his meaning could not be, that he would have them enquire, whether Matter of Fact was not <hi>true,</hi> or
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48910:33"/>

The Men of <hi>Sparta</hi> were wont to be Tryed, whether they had well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the Laws of <hi>Lycurgus;</hi> and ſuch of them as were found to have done ſo, were called <gap reason="foreign">

the Apoſtle tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 27. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall Eat this Bread, and Drink this Cup of the Lord <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nworthily, ſhall be guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord.</hi> And again, <hi>v.</hi> 29. <hi>He that Eateth and Drinketh <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nworthily, Eateth and Drinketh Damnation</hi> (or Judgment) <hi>to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not diſcerning the Lord's Body.</hi> In which two Verſes, the Apoſtle ſets down the Sin and the Puniſhment of thoſe, who go to the Lord's Table, as the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did, with Factious, Irreverent, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared Hearts.

For no leſs than the Spiritual Body of Chriſt is tendered by the Elements. And ſo, Secondly, the Unworthy and Irreverent Communicant Sinneth directly, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately againſt the <hi>Body</hi> of his Saviour;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48910:34"/>
he becomes Guilty of his Body and Blood, ſhewing by his Actions, that he hath a very <hi>low</hi> and <hi>mean</hi> regard, of that moſt Precious and Salutary Offering upon the Croſs. Now according to this twofold Sin, the Unworthy Receiver hath a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold <hi>Puniſhment.</hi> 1. Firſt, he <hi>Eateth and Drinketh his own Damnation,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul.</hi> As the Devout and Sincere-hearted Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant Receives the Pledges of a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Immortality, by Receiving the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Symbols; ſo doth he that intrudes rudely, take that which is the occaſion of his Everlaſting Ruine, without true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. The Devil enters in with the Morſel, as he did into <hi>Judas,</hi> not to be caſt out, but by Prayer and Faſting, and a ſtrong Repentance. For as the Bodily Preſence of Chriſt in the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> was an <hi>occaſion</hi> of Condemnation to thoſe who Received him not then by <hi>Faith;</hi> ſo doth his <hi>Myſtical</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> Preſence here, accidentally turn to the Prejudice of ſuch as Receive him not now in a due manner.

I ſhall ſay no more upon this Theme, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that what hath been delivered now, is ſufficient to Convince Men of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of due Preparation: And I had ſcarcely ſaid ſo much, but that it is a thing which lyeth before us in our way, and I could not leap over it with an Honeſt Conſcience. In many other Caſes Men need a Bridle, rather than a Spur; but in this Caſe, a Spur ſeems to be more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary than a Bridle; becauſe ſuch is the ſhameful neglect of this Ordinance, which many are Guilty of, that we ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſe <hi>Protrepticks,</hi> to provoke Men unto their Duty, than <hi>Threats</hi> and <hi>Mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> to deter them from Receiving. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that they may not make more haſte than good ſpeed, it behoved me to ſhew, what <hi>Cautions</hi> they are to take along

               </head>
               <p>THIS is a Matter of great weight and Conſideration; though a very ſlight account is made of it by thoſe, whoſe great care and ſolicitude ſeems to be, to whiſper their Crimes to the Ear of a Confeſſor, and to undergo or Promiſe ſome trifling Pennance; and if after theſe little Practices, they have the Abſolution of a Prieſt (who yet perhaps, is equally involved in the Communion of Guilt with his Penitents) they think themſelves ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently purged from the Conſcience of Sin, and to be perfectly Innocent. And this naturally followeth from the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of thoſe Doctors, who Teach, that <hi>Confeſſion</hi> and <hi>Penance,</hi> are the neceſſary Preparatives before the Sacrament; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any the leaſt mention of a <hi>Lively Faith</hi> in Chriſt. And although they ſpeak of the Neceſſity of <hi>Contrition</hi> (or <hi>Attrition</hi> at leaſt) yet by thoſe words, they underſtand no more, but a little
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48910:36"/>
grief for Sin, with ſome few purpoſes at preſent to amend hereafter; which they think to be ſufficient, becauſe, according to their Fancy, the work of the Prieſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies and makes amends for the want of a true and Manly Repentance of the Heart. Now this is ſo far from being a due Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the Sacrament, that 'tis a Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous and trifling Method, made up of lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crative Arts and abſurd Performances; and ſerveth to Corrupt and Debauch Chriſtianity, and to encourage People in a Wicked and Irreligious courſe of Life; as any Man may diſcern, that will but obſerve, the Natural Conſequences thereof.</p>
               <p n="1">1. THEREFORE for the Reſolution of this point, and for the Satisfaction of Mens Conſciences in this particular, we are firſt to Note, in the general, that U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Sanctity and Purity of Mind is required of us, in order to a Profitable and Comfortable Communion. It was the Opinion even of a <hi>Pagan,</hi> that <hi>ſuch as meddle with things Sacred, ought to be Chaſte and Holy, not</hi>

                  <hi>for a certain number of days only, but throughout their whole Life.</hi> And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a <hi>conſtant courſe of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> is the beſt Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48910:37"/>
for a due Celebration of this Myſtery; becauſe nothing can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to be ſo acceptable unto God, as a <hi>Life of Innocence.</hi> Yet if a Man hath <hi>loſt</hi> his Innocence, either through the Practice of <hi>Habitual</hi> Sin, or through the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſome Unlawful <hi>Acts;</hi> his <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> nevertheleſs is for Chriſt's ſake ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of in <hi>lieu</hi> of it, if that Repentance be <hi>Hearty</hi> and <hi>Sincere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NOW Repentance cannot be right, unleſs the Heart be entirely good, ſo as to be out of Love with every thing that is baſe and inconſiſtent with the Laws of Chriſt's Religion. And therefore a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant's mind and purpoſe muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely fixt upon the Practice of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Chriſtian Piety.</hi> Though ſome <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> Virtues are here more eſpecially to be Exerciſed, becauſe there are at this time particular <hi>Reaſons, and ſpecial Objects</hi> to Exerciſe his <hi>Faith, Charity,</hi> and the like; yet there ought to be an <hi>Habitual Preſence</hi> of <hi>other</hi> Virtues too; the frame and diſpoſition of our Spirits muſt be ſuch, as is Anſwerable to the whole Tenor of the Goſpel. <hi>Bonum ex integris, malum ex quolibet defectu:</hi> He cannot be ſaid to be an entire Good Man, nor a right Good Communicant, that has not an entire and Univerſal Love of Religion, in ſuch a
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48910:37"/>
meaſure, as by the Mercies of the New Covenant is now accepted of. Each Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace muſt contribute ſomething to make up our Wedding Apparel; the <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of Charity,</hi> the <hi>Ornaments of a meek and gentle Spirit,</hi> the <hi>clothing of Humility,</hi> the <hi>ſackcloth of Repentance</hi> and <hi>ſelf-denyal,</hi> the long Robe of <hi>Patience and Conſtancy,</hi> the <hi>New</hi> Apparel of <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Forgiveneſs.</hi> In a word, we ought to be ſo <hi>Perfect,</hi> as to be <hi>Sincere,</hi> and to <hi>be ready unto every good work,</hi> according to the beſt of our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and to the uttermoſt of our Power. All Affection and Love to Sin muſt be caſt off; and Mens Hearts muſt be Devoted to the obſervation of all the Laws of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, as his Spirit ſhall enable us, by working <hi>in us,</hi> and <hi>with us,</hi> and by <hi>helping our Infirmities.</hi> He that is not thus diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, cannot Communicate Worthily, and ſo as to obtain a Bleſſing. And the Reaſon is clear, becauſe (as I have ſhewed at large) this is a <hi>Covenant Feaſt</hi> under the Goſpel, as the Paſchal Supper, and other Sacrifical Banquets were under the <hi>Law.</hi> By taſting of this Bread and Wine we enter into Solemn <hi>Engagements</hi> unto God, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did by Eating of the <hi>Lamb.</hi> As <hi>they</hi> did by that Holy Rite addict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Worſhip of God, and engage their Obedience to him, conformable to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48910:38"/>
thoſe <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Ordinances,</hi> which were Enacted <hi>then;</hi> even ſo do we Chriſtians Conſecrate our ſelves by this <hi>Evangelical</hi> Solemnity to the Service of God, and vow Obedience to him, anſwerable to that way and platform, which he hath laid before us <hi>now.</hi> This is the <hi>meaning</hi> of this Myſtery; and therefore 'tis called a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> becauſe 'tis like the old <hi>Military Oath,</hi> binding all of us to be <hi>Faithful</hi> and <hi>True</hi> to the <hi>Captain of our Salvation.</hi> Now this is that which he hath <hi>commanded</hi> us by the Mouth of his Apoſtle, that <hi>as he who hath called us is Holy, ſo we alſo ſhould be Holy in all manner of Converſation,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 15. And this we undertake to do, when we Eat and Drink here before the Lord, if we rightly underſtand what we do. We ſtipulate and vow to Obey the Will of God in all things; and promiſe Solemnly to <hi>deny all ungodlineſs and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Luſts,</hi> and in expreſs terms do <hi>offer and preſent unto God our ſelves, our Souls and Bodies, to be a holy, reaſonable, and lively Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice unto him.</hi> Now unleſs we really <hi>intend</hi> what we do <hi>Profeſs,</hi> and do ſtedfaſtly <hi>purpoſe,</hi> and diligently endeavour to make all our Promiſes good, what elſe can we be ſuppoſed to do, but to ſet forth our own ſhameful <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> inſtead of <hi>ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the Lord's Death?</hi> Therefore, if
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48910:38"/>
we intend to Receive this <hi>Sacrament</hi> with Profit, and to our Eternal Salvation, we muſt reſolve with our ſelves to be <hi>upright</hi> and <hi>ſincere</hi> in Heart; to <hi>lay aſide all filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Fleſh and Spirit, perfecting Holineſs in the fear of God;</hi> to take to our ſelves <hi>the whole Armour of God,</hi> and to quit and behave our ſelves <hi>like Men.</hi> We muſt <hi>reſolve</hi> to ſerve God all our days with Reverence and Fear, and to make him the Object of our Deſires, and the Portion of our Souls; to be Holy in our Affections, to be Humble in Soul, to be Meek and Peaceable in Spirit, to be Sober and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate in our Delights; to be Contented in all Conditions, and to be Patient under our Croſſes, as the Prince of Peace was under <hi>his:</hi> To be Thankful for our Afflictions, to be conſtant and firm in our Tryals, and to be Charitable in all our Prayers, as he himſelf was, who Prayed unto his Father at the very laſt gaſp, for the Forgiveneſs of his Enemies. Men muſt not be ſo vain, as to imagine, that they are ſufficiently Prepared, if they do but find within themſelves ſome preſent Raptures, and Liquoriſh apprehenſions of the Love of God; if they can but breath out ſome Groans, or diſſolve themſelves into a ſhower of Water. No; the right Preparation of the Heart conſiſteth in the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48910:39"/>
                  <hi>entire Love of Virtue,</hi> of whatſoever things <hi>are True,</hi> and <hi>Honeſt,</hi> and <hi>Juſt,</hi> and <hi>Pure,</hi> and <hi>Lovely,</hi> and of <hi>Good Report,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 8.</p>
               <p>AND thus much may ſuffice to be ſpoken briefly, of the Quality and Nature of due Preparation <hi>in general:</hi> It muſt be an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Rectitude and Holineſs of Heart,</hi> an <hi>entire Goodneſs of Diſpoſition,</hi> a <hi>ſincere Love of that Religion, which is Pure and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndefiled,</hi> and ſuch a <hi>Divine frame and bent of Soul,</hi> as utterly <hi>Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth</hi> all that is Evil and Deſtructive of that Obedience, which is due both to the firſt and ſecond Table of the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue.</p>
               <p n="2">2. BUT then we muſt Note, in the next place, that as there ought to be this <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> and <hi>habitual</hi> Preparation, ſo there are ſome <hi>Particular</hi> and <hi>Special</hi> Duties, which are now to be performed, becauſe (as I ſaid) here are <hi>ſpecial Objects and Reaſons</hi> to ſtir us up to the performance of them. Here the Paſſion of Chriſt is repreſented, the Pardon of our Sins is tendered, and the infinite Love of God is Exhibited to us. And accordingly we are to lay hold on Chriſt's Merits with all our Souls, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Merits are available to ſuch only as do <hi>Believe:</hi> We are truly and earneſtly to <hi>Repent</hi> of our Sins, becauſe Sin was
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48910:39"/>
that which Chriſt Dyed for, and 'tis upon our Repentance that our Pardon is Sealed; and moreover we are to expreſs our entire <hi>Love</hi> to our Brethren, in all its Acts and Offices; becauſe, <hi>if God ſo Loved us, we ought alſo to Love one another,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 11. Hence it is, that Divines commonly Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe <hi>Faith, and Repentance, and Charity,</hi> as moſt neceſſary Preparatives in order to a worthy Receiving; not as if <hi>other Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues</hi> were to be excluded, but becauſe <hi>theſe</hi> are <hi>ſpecially</hi> to be Exerciſed, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as this great Solemnity doth afford us Special and Eminent <hi>Objects</hi> for the Exerciſing of them. I ſhall therefore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the uſual Method, being now to ſhew, how Prepared you ought to be, and what Preparations are ſufficient; and for your more Profitable Inſtruction, I ſhall Diſcourſe particularly of thoſe three Qualifications, in their due order.</p>
               <p>1. AND firſt of <hi>Faith,</hi> which is the Mother and Nurſe of all True Religion. By Faith I mean here, in the ſtrict Notion of it, an Act of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a Man is convinced and ſatisfied of the Truth of thoſe things which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to our Belief by Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, diſtinguiſhing <hi>Faith</hi> from <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> and other Acts of the <hi>Will,</hi> which are <hi>included</hi> in the Notion of Faith,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48910:40"/>
when 'tis taken in a <hi>larger</hi> and more <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive</hi> Senſe. Now in the purſuit of this Subject, I ſhall do theſe two things. 1. Firſt ſhew, <hi>why Faith</hi> is required in a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant, that we may underſtand the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity</hi> of this part of our Duty. 2. What <hi>Faith</hi> is required; or what we are bound to Believe; that we may ſee the <hi>Extent</hi> of it. And when this is done, I know not what more will be needful to be ſpoken, touching this matter.</p>
               <p n="1">1. WHY Faith is required in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant? And the Reaſon of it is obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; becauſe it is the Principle that doth influence, move, and govern our Actions; it being unconceivable, how a Man ſhould be wrought upon, either to put his Truſt in God, or to forſake his Impieties, or to do any other Act of Religion, unleſs he be firſt perſwaded in his Mind, that the Author of our Religion had Authority from God to exact theſe things at our Hands, and that there is Mercy with God if we be careful to do our Duty; and that nothing but Puniſhment is to be expected, if we <hi>neglect and deſpiſe ſo great Salvation.</hi> So that without Faith, <hi>as it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> ſo it is impoſſible to anſwer the <hi>ends</hi> and <hi>purpoſes</hi> of this Ordinance; and conſequently, the Elements that are taken by an Unbeliever, can do him
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48910:40"/>
no more good than a Morſel put into a Dead Man's Mouth. Even the Word that is Preached doth not profit at all, if it be <hi>not mixed with Faith in them that hear it, Heb.</hi> 4. 2. A thouſand Homilies of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs are no more to ſuch, than Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical Diſcourſes to a Brute. In like manner, the Adminiſtration of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though to well-prepared Souls it be the Communication of Chriſt's Body and Blood, yet it availeth not, except there be a Diſpoſition and Principle of Faith in them that Receive it. It is obſervable, that while our Saviour's Body was on Earth Locally, though a Medicinal Vertue went out of it, ſo that they who did but touch the borders of his Garment, were Healed of their Diſeaſes, yet it did not operate effectually, without ſome previous Preparation of Faith. In <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 28. He told the Woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that would not be put off, before he had taken Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion upon her Child, <hi>O Woman, great is thy Faith; be it unto thee, even as thou wilt.</hi> And when the Woman with a Bloody Iſſue, had but touched his Cloaths, though ſhe was afraid, for her Preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being at laſt diſcovered, yet received ſhe this Gracious Anſwer, <hi>Daughter, be of good Comfort; thy Faith hath made thee whole, Matth.</hi> 9. 22. On the contrary.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48910:41"/>
you ſhall find, that the Incredulity of People did, as it were, bind up the Hands of his Omnipotence, and ſhut up the Bowels of Compaſſion, ſo that his Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles were very few, where their Faith was very rare. A clear inſtance we have in <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. in his own Country (at <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth)</hi> he did not many Mighty Works, <hi>becauſe of their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief, v.</hi> 58. ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he did; for he Healed a few Sick Perſons who had <hi>Faith</hi> to be Healed; but St. <hi>Mark</hi> tells us, that <hi>many mighty works he could not do there. Marc.</hi> 6. 5. Now to bring down this Conſideration to our preſent Buſineſs: The Body of Chriſt doth ſtill caſt like Influences and Virtues from Heaven, and his Spirit doth Diſpenſe them at this Sacrament; but he Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them according to his good Pleaſure; and he is not pleaſed to work Miracles on ſuch as do not Believe; but every one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth it, according as he is Prepared by Faith. We ſee the Sun darteth his Beams into the bowels of the Earth inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, and maketh every Plant to Bud, and Germinate, and Shoot forth; but yet his Rays have no Power over Roots that are <hi>Dead</hi> and <hi>Rotten.</hi> And yet <hi>there</hi> is a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and Irreſiſtible power over things below; whereas the Influences which flow down from the Man Chriſt Jeſus, do not
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48910:41"/>
act Phyſically and after an uncontroulable manner, neither is there that intrinſick Power in the Sacrament, or ſuch Virtues of the Spirit going along with it, as to work upon Hearts, that are not opened to its Operations by a Lively Faith. No; the Sacrament is the outward and Ritual Means; but Faith is the Moral and inward Inſtrument of bringing Chriſt to the Soul, and every Man's Receipts are according as he Believes. And therefore among other things which we are to ſearch and enquire into, we muſt be careful to look well into our <hi>Creed,</hi> and in the firſt place Examine our ſelves, whether we <hi>be indeed in the Faith,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 13. 1. Meaning, that we muſt approve our Faith unto God, and our Conſciences, and ſee that it be ſuch as the Goſpel requires; and our Hearts muſt bear us Witneſs, that we Believe as we ſhould do, before we preſume to Eat of this Bread, and to Drink of this Cup.</p>
               <p n="2">2. NOW becauſe no Man is able to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove his Faith, or to make any Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it at all, unleſs he doth firſt know, <hi>what</hi> his Faith <hi>ought</hi> to be, and how far it is required to <hi>extend;</hi> therefore I ſhall proceed to the ſecond thing I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to ſhew, <hi>viz.</hi> What it is that every Communicant is obliged to Believe, that
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48910:42"/>
you may be ſatisfied in your Minds, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you are ſufficiently Prepared for the Communion in this reſpect. And this I ſhall do the rather, becauſe many have ſpoken very looſely and extravagantly upon this Theme, as if none could be a Worthy Receiver, except he be perſwaded in his Mind, that God Elected him to Salvation from all Eternity, and except he be aſſured that all his Sins are certainly Pardoned, and that he ſhall be Abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Infallibly Saved in the day of the Lord. Which Conceits, I am confident, have ſerved to deter thouſands from this Admirable and Heavenly Ordinance; who, though they had never ſuch good Meanings, and honeſt Purpoſes, and were (as we may believe) Sincere in their Hearts, yet becauſe they could not find themſelves thus perſwaded, have refrained coming to the Lord's Table, to the great diſquiet and prejudice of their Souls. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to remove this rub out of the way, be pleaſed to take notice, that it is not abſolutely neceſſary for a Man, before he goes to the Sacrament, to be confidently aſſured of his preſent Forgiveneſs, or his Future Felicity. We do not deny, but all Men muſt be aſſured of the Truth of God's Promiſe in the general. Nor do we deny, but that every one is to believe in
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48910:42"/>
particular, that he himſelf may be Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and ſhall be Happy on Condition, that he Sincerely and Honeſtly endeavours to obſerve the Precepts of the Chriſtian Religion. We do not deny neither, but a ſtrong aſſurance there may be in ſome Eminent Members of the Church, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when they come to Dye. But that every one is <hi>bound</hi> before he doth Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, to be <hi>Abſolutely and Peremptorily</hi> aſſured of his Happineſs, is a very Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant and groundleſs Conceit: And that for theſe two Reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. BECAUSE the Scripture ſaith no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this or that Man's particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. God hath not made any ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations in his Word, and therefore we are not bound to be aſſured of the thing. For the Word of God <hi>written</hi> is the Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate Rule of our Faith: So we rightly affirm againſt the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> with reſpect to their <hi>Traditions;</hi> and ſo we are to affirm againſt all Enthuſiaſts too, with reference to their Airy and Confident <hi>Opinions.</hi> The Holy Scriptures are our Guide; and what they do not ſay, is not neceſſary for any of us to Believe. <hi>Quod de Scripturis non habet autoritatem, eadem facilitate contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitur, qua probatur,</hi> as St. <hi>Jerom</hi> ſaid; meaning, that <hi>whatſoever cannot be proved by the Authority of the Scriptures, ought</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:48910:43"/>
                  <hi>not to be Believed as a Neceſſary Article of Faith.</hi> Now look into the Bible, and ſee if you can find <hi>your</hi> Names written there, or in the Book of Life; if you can any where find it ſaid, that <hi>your</hi> Sins are Pardoned; or if you can diſcover any Abſolute Decree, that <hi>you</hi> ſhall Infallibly be Saved. 'Tis true, the Word of God gives us all many Excellent <hi>Promiſes,</hi> many great and comfortable <hi>Hopes,</hi> but ſtill it ſpeaks in <hi>General;</hi> that <hi>they</hi> who Believe ſhall not Periſh; that they who Repent ſhall be Forgiven; and that <hi>they</hi> who perſevere in well-doing unto the end, ſhall be Saved: But it ſaith not in <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,</hi> that <hi>I</hi> am ſuch, or that <hi>I</hi> ſhall fare ſo: Onely indeed I may draw Particulars out of Generals, by way of Argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Rational <hi>Diſcourſe;</hi> and I may Judge of my ſelf, by meaſuring my ſelf with the <hi>Rule,</hi> and by comparing my Condition and State with the Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terms; and ſo I may have very comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſtrong <hi>Hopes</hi> (enough to quiet my Mind and Spirit) that I am in a State of Grace, and that God will ſhew Mercy unto me in that day; but to go farther, and to be Abſolutely <hi>Aſſured</hi> of all this, is not neceſſary, becauſe we have no plain <hi>Revelation</hi> to ground that aſſurance upon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe ſuch an aſſurance, were I poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48910:43"/>
of it, could not be a <hi>Divine,</hi> but an <hi>Humane</hi> Faith; and conſequently it would be <hi>Fallible</hi> and very uncertain. For it muſt be grounded meerly on my reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon my ſelf, and upon my comparing my Condition with the Word of God: So that my Judgment touching mine own State is ſtill but an <hi>Humane</hi> Act, ariſing from thoſe Obſervations which I my ſelf make; and I cannot as firmly and reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably believe that I am a Penitent, as I do believe that God will Pardon Penitents, becauſe I have <hi>His</hi> word for the latter, and only my own word for the former: And we know that every Man is ready to be <hi>Partial</hi> to himſelf, and Naturally apt to think better things of himſelf than he ought to think, and to take every Mole in his Face for a Beauty-ſpot. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſince a Man cannot have any aſſurance of his State, but by private Reflections upon himſelf; ſeeing ſuch a reflection is an Humane Act; and ſince every work of Man is deceitful, it plainly follows, that ſuch an aſſurance is not neceſſary. I wiſh therefore that Men would be Modeſt in theſe and the like Caſes, and not impoſe ſuch burdens upon their own and other Mens Conſciences, as may ſerve, to rack and diſquiet their Minds, but cannot ſettle them upon a firm bottom. The Faith
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48910:44"/>
of Chriſt is of an obvious Nature; and ſince the way to Heaven is ſtrait already, Men ſhould be very careful, that they do not <hi>add</hi> to the difficulties, by inventions of their own Brains, and render that entrance impoſſible, which already is ſo narrow, that <hi>few there be that find it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN Anſwer then to this Enquiry, What it is that every Communicant is bound to Believe? I ſhall lay down this as a fair and ſatisfactory Truth, that the Faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, is a <hi>Cordial</hi> and <hi>Comfortable</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of the <hi>verity of the common Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Chriſtianity compriſed in the Creed;</hi> and particularly, <hi>that Chriſt is ſo the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the World, that he is able to ſave all to the uttermoſt that come unto God by him,</hi> which is the Senſe of that <hi>Article,</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Remiſſion of Sins.</hi> Theſe are plain Aſſertions, for which we have the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Scriptures; and when I call this, a <hi>cordial</hi> and <hi>comfortable</hi> Perſwaſion, I mean ſuch a ſtedfaſt Belief in Chriſt, as ſerves to apply Chriſt's Merits to a Man's own <hi>ſelf;</hi> which Divines call, a <hi>Particular</hi> Faith. To believe in Chriſt <hi>Comfortably,</hi> is not only to Aſſent to the Truth of the Goſpel at <hi>Large,</hi> and in a <hi>General</hi> Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; but moreover, to believe for ones <hi>ſelf;</hi> to be throughly ſatisfied, that Chriſt was the True Meſſiah, that came to ſeek
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48910:44"/>
and to Save that which was loſt, and to Save even <hi>Me</hi> among others: That he Taſted Death for <hi>every Man,</hi> and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular for <hi>Me,</hi> that his Blood is the Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation for the Sins of the whole World, and even for <hi>Mine;</hi> that he is an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with the Father for my Brethren, and for <hi>Me</hi> alſo; that he hath Promiſed Eternal Life to all that do Obey him, and that even <hi>I</hi> ſhall have benefit by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, if <hi>I</hi> make good the Condition. In a word, that He is the Redeemer of all Mankind, and that with him there is Plenteous Redemption for <hi>Me,</hi> and for <hi>Thee,</hi> and for us <hi>All,</hi> if we be not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our ſelves. To be thus perſwaded, is enough for any Communicant, <hi>in genere fidei,</hi> and as to Matters of Faith. Indeed, <hi>in genere morum,</hi> as to Matter of Practice, Repentance and Univerſal Obedience is neceſſary too: But now we are conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, not how much it is neceſſary for a Communicant to <hi>Practice,</hi> but how much is needful for him to <hi>Believe;</hi> and ſuch a Faith as I have now deſcribed, is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, if Men do but add to this Faith, <hi>Virtue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. THAT this is ſo, will eaſily appear, if we impartially conſider, firſt, that this is the Faith which is neceſſarily <hi>required</hi> of all Chriſtians; and is ſufficient for all.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48910:45"/>
                  <hi>This is Eternal Life, that they know Thee the only True God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent,</hi> ſaith our Bleſſed Saviour himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 3. The Senſe of which place is, that the ſincere and hearty ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledgment of the True God, and of his Holy Child Jeſus, is the Infallible way to Everlaſting Happineſs. There are many Truths wrapped and folded up in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of that Text, which the Compilers of the Apoſtolical Creed have drawn out into ſeveral Articles. To <hi>know</hi> Jeſus, or to Confeſs him to be the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſignifies in the Dialect of the Holy Ghoſt, to own him to have been ſent by God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; that he came to Redeem us, and to Bleſs us, and to Dye for us: To have a deep Senſe of the All-ſufficiency of his Merits; to believe that all Power both to Save and to Deſtroy, is put into his hands; and to be firmly perſwaded, that in, and through him Forgiveneſs of Sins and a Glorious Immortality may be obtained by all, that will lay hold on him, and Love him in Sincerity. Now if this Faith be ſufficient (as touching Matter of Faith) to Entitle a Man to <hi>Eternal</hi> Life (as our Saviour ſaith it is) then it is enough alſo to give a Man the Liberty of <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating;</hi> becauſe more cannot be required to admit us to the Lord's <hi>Table,</hi> than is
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48910:45"/>
neceſſary for our admiſſion into <hi>Heaven.</hi> Certainly that Faith which ſufficeth to bring us hereafter into the <hi>Preſence</hi> of the Lamb, muſt be ſufficient to bring us to the <hi>Supper</hi> of the Lamb; and that is, not a confident Preſumption of a Man's abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Pardon and Election unto Happineſs, but a firm and <hi>comfortable</hi> Perſwaſion, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt came into the World, to Save Sinners,</hi> which is a moſt <hi>faithful ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and worthy of all acceptation,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15.</p>
               <p n="2">2. THAT this Faith is enough for a Communicant will appear, Secondly, from its Anaglogy and Proportion to the Faith of the <hi>Firſt</hi> Diſciples. It was St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Confeſſion (for which he was called Bleſſed) <hi>Thou art Chriſt the Son of the Living God, Matth.</hi> 16. 16. It was <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi>'s Confeſſion, <hi>Lord I believe that thou art Chriſt the Son of God, that ſhould come into the world, Joh.</hi> 11. 27. It was the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch's Confeſſion, <hi>I believe that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God, Act.</hi> 8. 37. Nay indeed, it was the Confeſſion of all the Apoſtles, before every particular was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted which lay hid and folded up in it, <hi>We believe and are ſure, that thou art that Chriſt, the Son of the Living God, Joh.</hi> 6. 69. Now do but conſider and judge in your ſelves: Is it poſſible for any Ratianal Man
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48910:46"/>
to believe, that the Faith which ſerved for the Salvation of thoſe, will not be enough to Diſpoſe and Fit <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s</hi> for the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament?</hi> Certainly, by the ſame Faith whereby the Diſciples of Old <hi>felt</hi> and <hi>handled</hi> the Word of Life, we may alſo <hi>Feed</hi> on him. For this Faith is as unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable as the Author of it, who is the ſame <hi>yeſterday, and to day, and for ever.</hi> And if in that plain and eaſie Belief the Church went to Heaven of <hi>Old,</hi> why may we not do ſo <hi>ſtill?</hi> And why may we not go to the Sacrament, as to Heaven-gate, by that Faith whereby ſo many Thouſands have all along entered into Paradiſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. ESPECIALLY if we Conſider, in the 3<hi>d</hi> place, the Nature and Reaſon of this preſent Solemnity. It is the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Feaſt, by partaking whereof, we do Renew our Covenant with God, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did by Eating of the Paſſover. And hence we may conclude, that which Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitates a Man to <hi>enter</hi> into Covenant with God firſt of all, is ſufficient to Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie and Fit him for the <hi>Renewing</hi> of that Covenant now; becauſe the Terms of the Covenant are all along the ſame; and what we did at our Baptiſm, and do now again, is but the ſame thing acted over and over. Now it is evident from the Holy Scriptures, that the cordial belief
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48910:46"/>
of the Authority and Merits of Chriſt, was accounted enough in the Apoſtles days for the admiſſion of People unto Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, which is the <hi>Initiating</hi> Myſtery, at which God and Men do interchangeably Seal Indentures firſt of all. In <hi>Act.</hi> 8. we find <hi>Philip</hi> Preaching to the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Eunuch, and requiring a Confeſſion of his Creed, that he might be Baptized; and when the Eunuch made this ſhort Confeſſion, <hi>I believe that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God,</hi> it was thought enough to give him a right to the <hi>Seal</hi> of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and ſo ſtraightway <hi>Philip</hi> went down into the Water, and Baptized him, <hi>v.</hi> 38. The like we Read of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> how they directed the frighted Jayler, <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on the Lord Jeſus, Act.</hi> 16. 33. and inſtantly upon that Confeſſion, Baptized him. Now we do not any where read, or find any Reaſon to conjecture, that the Apoſtles demanded any other Faith of their Converts before the Communion, than what they had delivered unto them to prepare them for Baptiſm. The ſame Belief which qualified them for <hi>that,</hi> did alſo Qualifie them for this <hi>other</hi> Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for in <hi>Act.</hi> 2. where we meet with the firſt Converts, and a great number of them, even three Thouſand Souls, St. <hi>Luke</hi> relates, that <hi>they were Baptized, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued</hi>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:48910:47"/>
                  <hi>ſtedfaſt in the Apoſtles Doctrine, and in breaking of Bread, v.</hi> 42. And by the Story it ſeems to be intimated, that in a very ſhort time after they were Baptized, they were all admitted to the Lord's Table.</p>
               <p>I add to this, in the laſt place, that the Primitive Church of Chriſt required this of Communicants, that they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thoſe things to be True, which were taught them by their Paſtours; for ſo <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> expreſly tells us; and thoſe things were no other, than the common Faith of all true Chriſtians in all Ages, and which in the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the Catholick Faith; conſiſting of the Fundamental Articles of our Religion, which were antiently drawn up into ſhort Summaries. And by a paſſage in St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> it doth appear, that Baptiſed Perſons were not prohibited from coming to the Communion, but for the ſpace of a few days after their Baptiſm: And this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition was intended, not that they might in that time learn a <hi>New Creed;</hi> but only gain ſome further Knowledge, touching the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Ends</hi> of this Religious Myſtery; ſtill the Faith was one and the ſame, even a <hi>comfortable belief in Jeſus Chriſt, and him Crucified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>TO all which, I ſhall only add the Judgment of the Church, as to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48910:47"/>
of that Faith, which is neceſſary for Baptiſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as it appears in the Office of <hi>Publick</hi> and <hi>Private</hi> Baptiſm, in the <hi>Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sick,</hi> in the Expoſition of the <hi>Creed,</hi> in the <hi>Catechiſm;</hi> as alſo in that old uſeful Book, called the <hi>Inſtitution of a Chriſtian Man:</hi> In all which, no more is lookt upon as neceſſary, but an hearty aſſent to the Truth of thoſe common Doctrines of Chriſtianity contained in the Apoſtolical Symbol.</p>
               <p>BY what then hath been thus particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſhew'd, any ordinary Communicant may eaſily diſcern, whether his Faith be genuine, and right, and approved, and ſuch as the Goſpel doth require. In ſhort, do you believe that the Holy Jeſus was the Son of God? That he came into the World, by the Appointment of his Father? That his great Errand, was to Redeem an undone and (without him) a loſt World? That he Dyed upon the Croſs for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? That his Blood was ſhed as a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom for all? That he paid a Price even for thy poor Soul? And that for his ſake thou may'ſt find Mercy at the hands of God? If this be thy Faith, thou may'ſt be aſſured, that thy Faith is as right and true, as ever was the Faith of an Apoſtle, tho' thou canſt not Remove Mountains, nor Heal the Sick with thy ſhadow. And
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48910:48"/>
therefore thou art thus far well Prepared to be a Receiver, becauſe this is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Object of every Chriſtian's Faith, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt is the Saviour of the World;</hi> and to believe thus much, with a <hi>particular application</hi> of Chriſt's Merits to thine own Soul, ſo that thou canſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it with Joy, and caſt thy ſelf on him with an Humble Confidence, and truſt to him for thy preſent Pardon and future Felicity, this is the proper Act of a Worthy Communicant.</p>

               <p>THERE is another <hi>Special</hi> Act of Religion, which not only every Communicant, but indeed every Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ought to employ the utmoſt of his Care about, and that is, <hi>Repentance from dead works,</hi> the Natural Fruit of Faith towards God. In diſcourſing of this, 'tis requiſite for me to ſhew, 1.

                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:48910:48"/>
1. FOR the right underſtanding of the Nature of Repentance, we muſt not rely upon the groundleſs, nay Superſtitious Conceits of the School-men, who place the whole Work of Repentance, in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, Confeſſion,</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction;</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that though a Man be never ſo broken in Heart, yet he is not a right Penitent, nor fit for the Communion, till he hath privately made an enumeration of his Sins to a Prieſt, and doth undergo, at leaſt doth Vow, and Promiſe to undergo ſome Ritual Penance, to Expiate his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences. At the bottom of this Doctrine there is a great deal of <hi>Trick</hi> and <hi>Artifice,</hi> which is quite Foreign to the deſign and buſineſs of Chriſtianity. For <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is a plain and admirable Method, to make Men univerſally <hi>Good;</hi> and to bring us to the Love of ſolid and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Vertue, that we may Live the Life of Angels (Pure and Holy) as far as it is conſiſtent with the Nature and Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mortal Men. Accordingly Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, means a Zealous and Paſſionate <hi>Abhorrence</hi> of every thing that is Evil in the <hi>Eye of God.</hi> The common Notion of Repentance implyeth thus much, that what a Man hath done, he wiſheth were undone, and reſolves to do ſo no <hi>more.</hi> And this is the Notion, which the Chriſtian

               <p>THE Holy Scripture (which in this and all other neceſſary Speculations is our only ſure and infallible Guide) gives us this ſhort account of the Nature of Repentance, that it is the <hi>eſchewing of Evil, and the doing of Good.</hi> So that it is a perfect change of a Man's purpoſes and courſes, the forſaking of all Iniquity, a New State, a Life of Sanctity and Goodneſs: And they that place it in a little ſorrow of the Mind, joyned with Auricular Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the outward Auſterities and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements of the Body, ſhew more their Love of Childiſhneſs, and a regard for their own Intereſt and Authority over Poor People, than their Skill in ſound Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity. To <hi>Repent</hi> ſignifies in the <hi>Sacred Dialect,</hi> to become a <hi>New Man,</hi> to have
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48910:49"/>
an Heart Renewed and Transform'd, and to follow a New, that is a Religious courſe of Life. The Scripture indeed hath ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Expreſſions that ſignifie this change: 'Tis called a <hi>New Creature; the Renovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Mind and Spirit, the putting on of the New Man, the purging of the Heart from an Evil Conſcience, the abhorring of Evil and cleaving to that which is Good, the turning to God, the Dying to Sin, the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying of our Luſts and Affections, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from dead Works;</hi> and many more the like Expreſſions there are; but theſe are only various delineations of the ſame thing; ſeveral Words and Phraſes (proper to Divinity) whereby is meant, the total rectifying of a Man's Temper and Life; or as even an Heathen <hi>Hierocles</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Hieroc. <hi>in</hi> Pythag. <hi>p.</hi> 166.</note> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes it, <hi>the recovering of that clean Life, which by a mixture of Paſſions was Defiled, the correcting of all inconſiderate courſes, the ſhunning of all Fooliſh Actions and Words, and the Inſtitution of ſuch a Life as is not to be Repented of.</hi> For our Nature being <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated</hi> and <hi>depraved,</hi> the Buſineſs of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is, to new-mould our Tempers, to take away every thing that ſowers Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and unbecometh Creatures that ought to be governed by right Reaſon, and ſo by degrees to bring us, as near as 'tis poſſible, to the Temper of Chriſt,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48910:50"/>
and to the Nature of God himſelf. The <hi>Reaſon</hi> of it is, becauſe the ultimate end of Chriſt's Religion, is to make us per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly <hi>Happy</hi> in another World; in order whereunto, 'tis abſolutely neceſſary for us to partake of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> in this Life, and to be made like unto God in Goodneſs and Purity. For all Happineſs doth conſiſt in the Enjoyment of that which Anſwers ones Deſires, which agrees with his Mind, which is ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to his Faculties, which gives him all manner of Satisfaction. So that in the Nature of the thing, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a Man to be fit for the Enjoyment of Heaven, that is not of an Heavenly Mind and Temper. The Condition of that place is not ſuitable to the frame and diſpoſition of any filthy Heart: And therefore every Evil Man that Dies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Heart is changed, muſt be Miſerable of courſe, for he carries a Hell along with him, he goes out of the World with ſuch a Temper, as makes him fit only for the Society and Converſation of <hi>Wicked</hi> Spirits. Men that are Fierce, Haughty, and Froward, Men that are full of Malice and bitterneſs; Men that hate every thing that is good; Men that delight in Cruelties and Bloodſhed; Men that are Contentious, Vexatious, and Trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48910:50"/>
Men that are in Love with Miſchief, that Live without God, that mind only Earthly and Wicked things, and that wallow in Senſualities and Uncleanneſs; whither can we ſuppoſe ſuch Deviliſh Tempers <hi>fit</hi> to go, but to the Company of Devils and Spirits like unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? It requires a great deal of care and pains, to mend a Man's Nature, to recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and regulate his Temper, ſo as to diſpoſe him for the Enjoyment of God, and to make him <hi>receptive</hi> and <hi>capable</hi> of the Felicities of Heaven. It is an exellent Expreſſion that of St. <hi>Paul's, Col.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>Giving thanks unto the Father, who hath made us meet to be partakers of the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Saints in light;</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that hath made us <hi>fit</hi> for a Portion of that Inheritance; that hath ſo wrought upon our Hearts, that we are <hi>Prepared</hi> and <hi>Qualified,</hi> rightly <hi>Fitted</hi> and <hi>Condition'd</hi> for the Enjoyment of <hi>Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NOW all this is done by a ſincere and hearty Repentance; when a Man reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Love of God, and upon the Folly, Turpitude, and Heinouſneſs of his own Sins, is broken in Heart through a deep Senſe of them, and from that hour vows and reſolves upon entire Obedience to the Divine Will. Accordingly he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters preſently upon a New State of Life,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48910:51"/>
governing his Deſires with a ſtrong hand, checking his former Inclinations, keeping his Luſts and Affections under command, and ſtedfaſtly reſiſting thoſe Temptations which Betray'd him before into the hands of the Deſtroyer. By this means he extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates by degrees thoſe vitious habits, which once were not only his Life, but his <hi>Plague</hi> too, and by uſing himſelf to a courſe of Virtue and Religion (which he finds to be infinitely more <hi>eaſie</hi> and <hi>delightful</hi> as well as <hi>ſafe)</hi> he ſoon comes to be out of Love with Sin, and is ſo renewed in the Spirit of his Mind, that the great care and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of his Life, is to Reform himſelf Univerſally, and <hi>to yield up his Members as the Servants and Inſtruments of Righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS is briefly the Nature of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, a perfect and total change; and they are very dangerouſly miſtaken who are taught to believe, that if they find in themſelves ſome Remorſe of Conſcience, ſome trouble of Mind, together with ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and imperfect purpoſes of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, their Penitence is ſufficient, as long as they have the Prieſt's <hi>Abſolution.</hi> Alas<hi>!</hi> all this comes vaſtly ſhort of <hi>Reformation;</hi> without which all the reſt are <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:</hi> For all the <hi>Abſolutions</hi> in the World will do no good, without an utter deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and forſaking of Sin in the Penitent:
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48910:51"/>
nor will all his Fears, all his Remorſe, all his Confeſſions avail him, if when he goes for <hi>Abſolution,</hi> he looks with a kind and friendly Eye upon his <hi>Vices,</hi> and cheriſheth that Uncleanneſs in his Boſom, which by the Laws of God he is bound to caſt away. For it is no eaſie matter for any to lead a Lewd Life, without ſome trouble and unquietneſs of Mind; and for a Man firſt to Sin, and then Confeſs, and then Sin again, is nothing elſe, but to drive a <hi>circular</hi> Trade of <hi>Hypocriſie;</hi> for all this is very conſiſtent with a Wicked Life: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe after this rate, there is no neceſſity of entire and univerſal Holineſs, <hi>(without which,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>there is no ſeeing of God)</hi> but People may give themſelves up all their days to all manner of Wickedneſs and Villany, and may think to be Saved nevertheleſs. What a ſmooth and pleaſant way would this be into the Kingdom of God, were it but true? How eaſily after this rate is the Sinner and the Saint recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled? But what a Scandal is it to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and what a fatal prejudice is it to a good Life, when Men are taught ſuch an Artificial Method, how to Save their Souls, and their Sins too? For who will undertake that troubleſom and painful task, <hi>of Mortifying his Luſts,</hi> of <hi>parting with a right Eye,</hi> of <hi>cutting off a right hand,</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:48910:52"/>
and of being <hi>Crucifyed to the World,</hi> if he be perſwaded that he cannot poſſibly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry, as long as he hath at hand ſuch a preſent and eaſie Remedy as this is, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs and be Abſolved. Be not therefore deceived in a caſe of ſuch huge moment and weight. True Repentance is not a thing of ſuch quick and ſuperficial diſpatch, it muſt reach to the very <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row;</hi> it muſt alter and transform the <hi>whole Man,</hi> it muſt <hi>bring forth Fruits meet for Repentance;</hi> it muſt expreſs it ſelf by an Univerſal Obedience to the Precepts of the Goſpel, it muſt have that good effect upon Mens Spirits, as to make them follow whatſoever <hi>things are Juſt, and Honeſt, and Pure, and Lovely, and of good Report.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. THE <hi>Nature</hi> of Repentance being thus Explained, I ſhall not need to ſpend much time upon the next point, touching thoſe <hi>Special Grounds</hi> and <hi>Reaſons,</hi> which render Repentance neceſſary, before we go to the Communion. For every Man's Conſcience cannot but tell him, that he ought to come to ſo Sacred a Myſtery with clean Hands, and a very pure Heart. However, that Diſcourſes of this kind may not ſeem fantaſtical and groundleſs, the Neceſſity of this thing will plainly appear from theſe following Conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From that <hi>Analogy</hi> which this Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48910:52"/>
Chriſtian Feaſt beareth unto thoſe Antient <hi>Sacrifical</hi> Feaſts, of which I have formerly Diſcourſed at large. At thoſe Solemnities (as <hi>Gyraldus</hi> obſerves) even the Heathens thought it the moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part of their Religion, <hi>to be free from an Evil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

They would waſh their Bodies in Rivers, and preſent themſelves at the Altars of their Gods in pure and clean Apparel, with waſhen Hands, and naked Feet, as ſignifications of the Purity of their Minds; and when the Solemnity began, as the Prieſt asked with a loud voice, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>who is here?</hi> So the People anſwered, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>many Men and Good;</hi> eſteeming Sanctity and Goodneſs to be abſolutely neceſſary in ſuch as were to Feaſt before their Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Among the <hi>Jews</hi> it was cuſtomary to uſe ſeveral Ritual ways of Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (ſuch as the cleanſing of their Bodies, and the ſcowring of their very Cloaths) before they preſented their Oblations unto God, or durſt to <hi>feed</hi> upon the <hi>remains</hi> of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48910:53"/>
their Sacrifices. They had divers waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and carnal Ordinances impoſed upon them, <hi>until the time of Reformation,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 10. One eminent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance we have, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. there <hi>Samuel</hi> goes to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> to Sacrifice unto the Lord, and to Feaſt with <hi>Jeſſe</hi> and his Sons upon part of the Oblations; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would either ſlay the Heifer, or ſit down with them at Meat, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them <hi>to Sanctifie themſelves,</hi> (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Cuſtom) <hi>v.</hi> 5. Now theſe legal Purifications, were ſo many Notices and Indications of that <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> Purity, which is neceſſary in all, who preſent themſelves before the Lord, and profeſs to be of his Houſhold and Family. For which Reaſon the Prophets, who were Expoſitors of the Law, called upon the People at every turn, to mind that Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Heart and Spirit, which was ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by theſe External Rites, and without which, all their Services were ſo many <hi>vain Oblations.</hi> So God himſelf calls them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1. 12, 13. <hi>When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my Courts? Bring no more vain Oblations;</hi> that is, <hi>Heartleſs</hi> Sacrifices, ſuch Sacrifices as were without the Heart, not of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> but of the <hi>Man;</hi> empty Services, that were without a broken
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48910:53"/>
and contrite Spirit. To this purpoſe 'tis ſaid, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. 3. <hi>He that killeth an Ox, is as he that Slew a Man; he that Sacrificeth a Lamb, as he that cutteth off a Dog's neck; he that offereth an Oblation, as he that offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the Blood of Swine;</hi> and the Reaſon follows, <hi>becauſe they have choſen their own ways, and their Soul delighteth in their own Abominations.</hi> 'Tis <hi>Holineſs</hi> that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, rather than Sacrifice; and ſo much was intimated to them, when they were appointed to <hi>waſh,</hi> before they entred into the Sanctuary. To which purpoſe, ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26. 6. <hi>I will waſh my hands in Innocence, and ſo will I compaſs thine Altar:</hi> Meaning, that by cleanſing the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, Men were taught to Cleanſe and Sanctifie their Minds, chiefly, and that Innocence is mainly neceſſary in ſuch as go about to meddle with Holy things. And this is particularly obſervable from the Ordinance concerning the Paſſover, which was a <hi>Type</hi> and <hi>Shadow</hi> of this <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Ordinance. Though every <hi>Jew</hi> that was rightly Qualified, was bound under pain of Death, to bring the Offering of the Lord in his appointed Seaſon; yet if he had any Legal <hi>Impurities</hi> upon him; if he were a <hi>Leper,</hi> or had a <hi>running Iſſue,</hi> or had <hi>been Defiled by touching a Dead Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſs,</hi> then he was ſeverely bound to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48910:54"/>
the Paſſover for a time; he was to defer it for the ſpace of a Month; becauſe it was a general Rule, the Soul that eateth the Fleſh of the Sacrifice of Peace-Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, having his Uncleanneſſes upon him, even that <hi>Soul ſhall be cut off from his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> Lev. 7. 20. <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi> hath right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerved, that God Inſtructed Men by theſe Rites and Forms and outward Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols, how they ought to make their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches unto his Altar, either to Pray or to give thanks unto him; that they ſhould bring no <hi>latent</hi> Diſeaſes, no Corruptions of <hi>Soul</hi> along with them. And never is it more neceſſary for Men to lay their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities aſide, than when they come to this Chriſtian Sacrifice. The Body of the Lamb was a Type and Figure of the Fleſh of Chriſt; and as we cannot refuſe Eating without being <hi>Guilty,</hi> as well as <hi>Fooliſh</hi> and <hi>Improvident;</hi> ſo neither can we be Innocent, if we Eat with our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſes about us; this is no other, than <hi>to Eat and Drink Judgment to our ſelves,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.</p>
               <p n="2">2. BESIDES, <hi>2dly,</hi> the Nature of this Great Myſtery is well to be conſidered, for (as I have ſhew'd) it is the <hi>Covenant Feaſt</hi> under the Goſpel, even as the Paſchal Supper, and other Sacrifical Banquets were under the Law: And Repentance
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48910:54"/>
is indiſpenſably required of all that come to <hi>Contract</hi> with God. There is a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able place in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. 16, 17. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the Wicked God ſaith, why doſt thou Preach my Laws, and takeſt my Covenant into thy Mouth, whereas thou hateſt to be Reformed?</hi> The Pſalmiſt doth manifeſtly allude to an Ancient Cuſtom of making Covenants with God by Sacrifice, as it is, <hi>v.</hi> 5. For the Offering being made upon the Altar, and part of it being burnt as <hi>God</hi>'s Portion, the remainder was taken away by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting Parties, as <hi>their</hi> ſhare; and their manner was, to Eat it together be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, thereby teſtifying that they were now in Communion and Fellowſhip with him. And this the Pſalmiſt calls; <hi>the taking of God's Covenant in their mouths;</hi> for it was the Eating of his <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> which was a <hi>Sign and Token</hi> of the Covenant. Now, what they did of Old, when they did Communicate of the Fleſh of Beaſts, That (the very ſame thing) we Chriſtians do now; when we partake of Bread and Wine, we do Solemnly Profeſs that we are in Covenant with God, and Solemnly Confirm this Covenant at his Table. Now the Terms of the Covenant under the Goſpel, are theſe on our part, that we will ſerve God in <hi>Holineſs and Righteouſneſs all the days of our Life;</hi> and if our inward
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48910:55"/>
intentions be not according to our outward Profeſſion, but we hate to be Reformed, what horrible Preſumption is it to take the Symbol and Seal of God's Covenant into our Mouths? All this is Mockage, and Hypocriſie, a Solemn and Theatrical kind of <hi>jeer,</hi> if Men do not ſtedfaly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve and purpoſe in their Hearts, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>New Men,</hi> and for ever to pleaſe God in <hi>Newneſs of Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. ADD to this, in the third place, that the Bleſſings tendred us at this Sacrament, are ſuch, as do require a Sincere Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from dead Works, as a Qualification and Diſpoſition to make us meet to be Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of them. For here Chriſt is ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, with all the Fruits and Benefits of that Sacrifice, which he once for all offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up to his Father upon the Croſs: And of theſe, Forgiveneſs of <hi>Sin</hi> is one great Bleſſing. But there is <hi>no Pardon to the Wicked,</hi> to ſuch as are ſtill in Love with their Abominations, and intend to perſiſt and go on in their Wickedneſs. In order therefore to a due Celebration of this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, as every Knee ſhould bow, ſo every Heart muſt be broken, and every filthy Luſt Mortified. For Converſion goeth <hi>before</hi> Forgiveneſs, as the <hi>Condition</hi> that Capacitates the Receiver; and the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Sin muſt be Conquered, before the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48910:55"/>
Guilt of it can be removed; it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for Vice and Grace to Reign toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or that God and Belial ſhould ſit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the ſame Throne. 'Tis Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance that Prepares the way for Mercy, and makes <hi>room</hi> for that Pardon, which we beg for at the Altar; and that we may be ſure of Forgiveneſs, we muſt ſo Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn all our Impieties, as to <hi>forſake</hi> them, and ſo to grieve for them, as to <hi>deteſt</hi> and <hi>abhor</hi> them. For Chriſt is not an Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, but a Conditional Saviour: Nor doth he Ranſom any by his Blood from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Death, but whom he Redeems, firſt by the aſſiſtance of his Grace from thoſe Iniquities, whereof <hi>Death is the Wages.</hi> All that Bliſs and Happineſs, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for us in Heaven, and whereof we have a <hi>foretaſt</hi> and <hi>earneſt</hi> at this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is the Portion of Holy Souls only, that Love the Lord Jeſus in Sincerity, and reſolve to Obey him.</p>

               <p>THIS being enough to ſhew the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Repentance in order to a due Communion; I proceed in the next place to ſhew, what <hi>Meaſures and Degrees</hi> of Repentance are neceſſary. For the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of this too, we muſt of neceſſity conſider the different Degrees and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Sin; becauſe Repentance muſt bear ſome <hi>Proportion</hi> to the Offence; and as a Man's Sins are of a <hi>greater</hi> or a <hi>leſſer</hi> Nature, ſo muſt his <hi>Repentance</hi> be alſo.</p>
               <p>NOW conſidering that the Act and Conſent of a Man's <hi>Will,</hi> is that which renders an Action <hi>formally</hi> Sinful, and the more wilful any Sin is, the more it <hi>riſeth</hi> and <hi>ſwelleth</hi> in greatneſs; we muſt firſt diſtinguiſh between <hi>Wilful</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nwilful</hi> Sins; for ſo it will the more fully and evidently appear, what degree that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48910:56"/>
muſt be of, which is to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable and ſuitable to <hi>both.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>WILF<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>L</hi> Sins then are ſuch, as are committed with a Man's full <hi>Approbation</hi> and <hi>Choice;</hi> when he deliberates upon it, or at leaſt hath means and time to delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and reſolves with himſelf to do the thing; either for the gratifying of ſome Luſt, or for the procuring of ſome worldly end, though he knows the Action to be contrary to God's Law, and might refrain from it, if he would make a due uſe of that ſtrength which God hath either fixed in his Nature, or added by his <hi>Grace.</hi> Such an Action is rightly ſaid to be <hi>wilful,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a Man's Will hath the greateſt hand and ſtroak in it. For we ſuppoſe in this caſe, that the Underſtanding is or may be ſufficiently informed, and that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations are not ſo ſtrong, nor the Temptations ſo great, but that they might be Victoriouſly Reſiſted, if the Party would but give his mind to it, and ſet his Heart to employ his Power and Abilities. And therefore the Sin is called <hi>Wilful,</hi> becauſe though ſome <hi>little</hi> fault may perchance lye both in his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Affections too, yet the <hi>main</hi> blame lyes upon the <hi>Will,</hi> for carrying the Action on with <hi>Reſolution</hi> and <hi>Obſtinacy;</hi> becauſe he is <hi>ſet</hi> upon frowardneſs.</p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NWILF<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>L</hi> Sins are ſuch, as have not the Conſent, or not the <hi>full</hi> Conſent of the Will; but proceed rather from ſome Natural and Hereditary <hi>Imperfection;</hi> either from a defect of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> by means whereof a Man either <hi>wants</hi> light in his Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or looks upon things in a wrong light (and then 'tis a Sin of <hi>Ignorance:)</hi> or elſe it proceeds from a defect of <hi>Strength,</hi> from ſome <hi>Inability</hi> and <hi>Lameneſs</hi> of Humane Nature, by means whereof his own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Inclinations within are too <hi>quick</hi> for him, or ſome Temptations from without are ſo ſudden, ſo <hi>thick,</hi> ſo <hi>violent</hi> againſt him, that he cannot hold out againſt <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> as the caſe ſtands, but doth that which he knoweth he ſhould not, in a hurry and without due <hi>Conſideration,</hi> his poor feeble Nature being over-born; and his Councels, which otherwiſe he would uſe, being prevented by a ſurpriſe (and this is that which is called, a Sin of <hi>Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Infirmity.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. OF theſe <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nwilful</hi> Sins I ſhall ſpeak in the firſt place; and in the Proceſs of this Diſcourſe, I ſhall, 1. give ſome particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of theſe Sins: And, 2. ſhew how far, and to what degree we are to Repent of them, before we come to the Bleſſed Sacrament.</p>
               <p n="1">1. THE Firſt kind of theſe <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nwilful</hi> Sins, and that which is the ground and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48910:57"/>
Original of all the reſt, is the <hi>Sinful Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> in every Man's Nature, that Prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Propenſity, and Aptneſs unto Evil, which cleaves to every Child of <hi>Adam</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably from the Womb; ſo that his Nature through meer Impotency and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary weakneſs, lies always <hi>bending</hi> and <hi>bowing</hi> towards <hi>Wickedneſs.</hi> Though good Men do not yield to this Inclination, and every Man hath ſufficient aſſiſtance from God to check it; yet all Men have more or leſs their ſhare of it, ſo that they are ſtill apt to flag and ſwerve from their Duty, though they be in a State of Grace and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation. This <hi>Natural Inclination</hi> and crookedneſs is termed <hi>Sin,</hi> becauſe <hi>materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> it is ſo, being a <hi>repugnancy</hi> to the Law of God, and a <hi>deviation</hi> from it. For all Sin is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as the Apoſtle defines it, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 4. <hi>A Tranſgreſſion of, or a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety unto, or a deflection and diſſonancy from the Law;</hi> and becauſe the Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Propenſity of our Nature is <hi>ſuch,</hi> therefore is it truly ſaid to be <hi>Sin</hi> and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>materially</hi> and in it ſelf. But yet on the other ſide, it cannot by any means be reckoned among <hi>wilful</hi> or <hi>voluntary</hi> Sins; becauſe this Inclination of Nature is not contracted by any Act of Man's own <hi>Will,</hi> by any conſent, choice, or approbation of his own; nor indeed hath he any more
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:48910:58"/>
hand in it, than he had in the Formation of his Body. It is no more his Will that he is Born with Evil Inclinations, than 'twas his Will he was made up of ſuch and ſuch parts, or that he came into the World, with an Appetite after Food, or with an Inclination to Sleep and Reſt, and ſuch other Natural Actions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. BESIDES this Natural <hi>Inclination</hi> and <hi>Aptitude</hi> unto Sin, there are ſeveral other things which come under the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Evil, but yet cannot be called <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Acts,</hi> but meer <hi>Infirmities.</hi> 1. As <hi>Evil thoughts,</hi> eſpecially in the firſt riſing of them, and when they are not attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſubſequent Actions, nor enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd with Pleaſure and Delight. I call ſuch thoughts <hi>Evil,</hi> becauſe they are of themſelves breaches of that Spiritual Law of God which reacheth the very <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Soul,</hi> and requires Purity in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts: But yet they are not to be accounted voluntary Tranſgreſſions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not Acts of the Will, the Reſults of deliberation and choice, but the ſudden breakings out of a Diſtemper'd Nature, things which our inward Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do ever and anon caſt out; as Putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Blood is apt upon fermentation to throw out Boyls and Bliſters, and the like. Indeed our Bleſſed Saviour, ſpeaking of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48910:58"/>
thoſe things which come forth from the Heart, and Defile a Man, mentioneth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly <hi>Evil Thoughts:</hi> Matth. 15. 18, 19. <hi>Thoſe things which proceed out of the mouth, and come forth from the Heart, they Defile the Man; for out of the Heart proceed Evil Thoughts,</hi> &amp;c. But in this place is meant, not thoſe indeliberate and <hi>ſudden</hi> ſtartings of the Mind, which I have now been ſpeaking of, but <hi>black Deſigns, ſtudyed Purpoſes,</hi> and <hi>Malicious Contrivances of the Heart,</hi> eſpecially againſt a <hi>Man</hi>'s Life, as our Learned Paraphraſt hath very rightly <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dr.</hi> Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond <hi>in</hi> Loc.</note> noted. Theſe inward motions which we feel within us, and which all Good People complain of, as long as they are <hi>bare thoughts</hi> and ſurpriſes of Soul, are not to be reckon'd as <hi>Wilful-Sins,</hi> nor are they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with a State of Grace and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. They are many times the effects of a Diſorder'd Brain, and of a Body Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper'd with the Spleen, Melancholy, and the like; ſo that they are often as Natural Effects of ſome Diſeaſe, as hot and cold fits are the effects of an Ague. They riſe in the Mind <hi>without</hi> ones Will, nay <hi>againſt</hi> it; and they are to Good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans an <hi>Affliction</hi> and <hi>Trouble:</hi> As they are <hi>afraid</hi> of them before hand, ſo they are apt to be ruffled when they come, and to be Diſcompoſed and Tormented for them
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48910:59"/>
when they are gone. This is a plain Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that in ſuch Perſons they are not <hi>Wilful Sins;</hi> and therefore they do not Defile them, ſo as to render them loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom or impure in the Eye of God: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they muſt be Repented of in ſome meaſure, as I ſhall ſhew in its proper place.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There are too divers <hi>Omiſſions,</hi> which the beſt of Men are Subject to be guilty of, through the common and inevitable courſe of Humane Affairs, and by Reaſon of the inſufficiency of Humane Nature, though aſſiſted with Divine Grace. Now God forbid we ſhould think, that all ſuch Omiſſions are Sins of <hi>Wilfulneſs;</hi> for many of them proceed from an <hi>hurry</hi> of Secular Matters, which makes even Good Men forgetful of ſome things, and unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully wanting in others; nor is it poſſible it ſhould be otherwiſe. Many Omiſſions alſo proceed from meer <hi>Inadvertency,</hi> in caſes which have no <hi>room</hi> for deliberation: Nay though a Man be never ſo cautions and conſiderate, yet 'tis not in his power to debate and conſult with himſelf in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>particular</hi> and <hi>minute</hi> contingency; the frail and narrow condition of Humanity will not allow it; nor is it imaginable, that any Man can be ſo watchful at all times, as not to Sleep at all, nor ſuffer any thing to <hi>eſcape him.</hi> The <hi>Spirit truly is</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:48910:59"/>
                  <hi>willing, but the Fleſh is weak,</hi> as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour told his Diſciples when they ſlept inſtead of Miniſtring Comfort to him, and Praying for him in his great Agony, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. And as long as we carry Fleſh about with us, ſo long we ſhall be wanting in ſome part or other of our Duty. The daily Sacrifice may be ſome times neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, at leaſt in ſome meaſure, and our Devotion may be miſſing for a while in a croud of Buſineſs. Serene and Pleaſant times are apt to draw out our thoughts from their cloſe retirements, like Bees ſporting in the Sun. The Neceſſities of the Saints are not always in our thoughts, and ſo thoſe thirſty Channels may remain without any Water from our Ciſtern. Many Bleſſed Opportunities, of doing our ſelves and others good, ſlide away from us inſenſibly; nay even in our Callings, to which commonly we Sacrifice moſt of our time and care, we are not always ſo vigilant and induſtrious, but that we may deſerve the Cenſure of ſome <hi>Negligence,</hi> though we may not deſerve the charge of <hi>Diſhoneſty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. There is another ſort of Infirmity, <hi>viz.</hi> a mixture of <hi>Imperfection</hi> in our very beſt Performances. Though the thing be done with an Honeſt and Good Heart, yet we come ſhort as to the <hi>Degree,</hi> and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48910:60"/>
fail more or leſs in the <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>doing</hi> it. <hi>Who can underſtand his Errors?</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 12. Such is our Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that like the Image which <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> ſaw in his Dream, it is not all of a Temper, but conſiſteth of a medly, ſo that there is ſomething in us of <hi>Gold,</hi> ſomething of <hi>baſer</hi> Metal, and ſomething of <hi>Clay:</hi> By means whereof it cometh to paſs, that our good Works are defective, and ſtand in need of a Pardon. We find by daily <hi>Experience,</hi> that what State ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we are in, what Graces ſoever we are to Exerciſe, what Duties ſoever we are to perform, many Infirmities ſtill cleave to us like a Leproſie which we cannot totally cure. In our Proſperity we are apt to be lifted up in our Minds; and when a ſweeping Affliction comes upon us, we are as ready to be diſcouraged and caſt down. Our Faith is apt to be attended with ſome diſtruſt, our Hopes with ſome Preſumption, our Obedience with ſome abatements of Love, our Charity with a little touch of Pride, our Meditations with a great deal of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction; and even at our Devotion, when we take <hi>down the ſtringed Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the wall,</hi> to chant out Praiſes and Prayers to our God, our Zeal ſuffereth ſome alloy by many wandring thoughts, nor do our Hearts keep exact time with
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48910:60"/>
our Voice, but are apt to <hi>flatten,</hi> and be out of <hi>tune,</hi> when our Mouths are full of Hoſanna's in the higheſt. <hi>Briefly,</hi> our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections are ſo deeply rooted in us, that we cannot get rid of them; in our Cloſets, in our moſt ſerious and fixt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations, they are with us; nay, the very Houſe of God is not a <hi>Sanctuary</hi> from them, but they are apt to bear us compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny even to the Altar: Yet this is for our Comfort, that if we ſincerely endeavour to Conquer and caſt them off, they are not Wilful Sins, nor will God reckon them unto us to our Condemnation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are <hi>Infirmities</hi> which we cannot help.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Beſides all theſe Infirmities, there are ſeveral <hi>indecent Actions,</hi> which though they cannot be juſtified, or totally excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, if rigorouſly conſider'd, yet cannot properly come under the Notion of Sins that are perfectly <hi>Wilful;</hi> becauſe they are not the reſult of mature <hi>Deliberation,</hi> but rather are done <hi>caſually,</hi> by means of ſome ſurpriſing Temptations <hi>without,</hi> which on a ſudden overcome ones <hi>Paſſions,</hi> or by means of ſome great diſturbance <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi> which for that time hinders the uſe of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and are too <hi>hard for it.</hi> Even in a State of Innocence, Man was ſet low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the Angels, though the Bruitiſh
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48910:61"/>
part was ſo Subject to the Rational Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of his Soul, that it was wholly under its command. Ever ſince the Fall, Mens Affections have been Rebels; which have been apt to over-maſter them, and carry them away againſt their Reaſon; becauſe Reaſon being many times wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſturbed by them, it is not powerful enough to Govern and Rule them. And though the Grace of God be abundant under the Goſpel, and very powerful in ſuch as humbly obey it; yet even in Men that are Regenerated by God's Spirit, there is ſtill a mixture of Good and Evil, as the hotteſt Tempers have ſome degrees of Cold; ſo that a Wiſe and Holy Man, may through <hi>Surpriſe,</hi> or <hi>Incogitancy,</hi> or the <hi>Violence</hi> of a Temptation, be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken unawares. It was not the caſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> alone, to ſpeak <hi>unadviſedly with his Lips,</hi> being provoked to it by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Murmurings: Nor was it <hi>David</hi>'s Caſe alone, to ſay in his haſte, <hi>all Men are Lyars;</hi> nay, it was not <hi>Peter</hi>'s Caſe alone, to deny his Lord through <hi>extremity of Fear.</hi> Every one is apt ſometimes to be born down by the Tempter, or by his own maſterful and diſorderly Paſſions; nor is there any Man but is ſenſible of ſome pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations of Soul, which are uſually oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned, either by his own Hereditary
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:48910:61"/>
weakneſs, or by ſome ill Accidents in his Family, or by ſome Troubles in his Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or by the diſappointment of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, or by the common Croſſes of the World, or by the Apprehenſions of ſome Evil to come, or by the Senſe of ſome Calamity that is paſt, or by a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Diſtemper and Sickneſs, in his Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and by divers Accidents more, which the Subtilty and Malice of the Tempter maketh uſe of to diſturb his Peace. Now, though in theſe Actions there be ſome <hi>little</hi> concurrence of the Will, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make them imputable to us, if God ſhould deal with us according to <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour</hi> and <hi>ſeverity,</hi> yet by the Mercies of the Goſpel, they are not actually impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a <hi>Good</hi> Man, becauſe they are not properly voluntary, that is, they proceed not from <hi>propenſe Malice,</hi> or a <hi>deliberate Judgment,</hi> but from ſudden and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing Contingencies, ſo that he would not be Guilty of them, were he not in Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Circumſtances.</p>
               <p n="2">2. THE Nature and Quality of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wilful Sins being thus Explained, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary now in the next place to conſider, <hi>how far,</hi> and to <hi>what degree,</hi> we are to Repent of them before we Eat and Drink at the Lord's Table: For if Men entertain falſe Notions of this matter, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48910:62"/>
for them to be Satisfied that they are duly Prepared, as long as they labour under thoſe Notions, eſpecially if they be People of <hi>Tender</hi> and <hi>Scrupulous</hi> Spirits.</p>
               <p n="1">1. FIRST then in general we muſt Note, that we are not obliged to Repent of Infirmities in ſuch an high degree, as to Vow, Promiſe, and Undertake, that we will keep our ſelves free from all manner of Sin. Though we are bound to be very watchful over our ways, and muſt reſolve with our ſelves not to act <hi>knowingly</hi> and <hi>preſumptuouſly</hi> againſt God's Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; yet it doth not lye in our <hi>Power</hi> to live wholly Innocent from <hi>every the leaſt offence.</hi> The Divine Grace doth <hi>aſſiſt</hi> and <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> our Natures, but it doth not <hi>Deſtroy</hi> them: <hi>Men</hi> we are <hi>ſtill,</hi> ſubject to the Frailties of Poor Mortal Creatures, and as long as we are compaſſed about with Fleſh, we cannot lead ſuch an <hi>Angelical</hi> Life, as to be clean from all Impurities, as thoſe Bleſſed Spirits in Heaven are. The Condition of our <hi>Nature</hi> cannot bear it; therefore the thing being impoſſible, we are not obliged at any time to reſolve upon ſuch <hi>high</hi> degrees of Sanctity as are out of our reach. For which Reaſon we cannot conceive our ſelves obliged to it in order to a due Celebration of the <hi>Euchariſt:</hi> For at this great Solemnity we renew that
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48910:62"/>
Covenant we made at our Baptiſm, which is, not to be void of all manner of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, but to Renounce the Devil and our own Luſts, <hi>ſo as not to follow or be led by them,</hi> (as our Church hath excellently expreſt it in the Office of Baptiſm) that is, ſo as not to be <hi>Govern'd,</hi> or <hi>Commanded,</hi> or <hi>Perſwaded</hi> by them, to do that which we <hi>know to be Evil.</hi> 'Tis ſaid indeed, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 9. that <hi>whoſoever is born of God, doth not commit Sin;</hi> nay, that <hi>he cannot Sin, becauſe he is born of God.</hi> But this is to be underſtood of Sins of <hi>forecaſt and deliberation,</hi> which profligate Perſons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit willingly and with greedineſs. There is in a Regenerated Perſon, ſuch a Vital Principle of Grace and Goodneſs, as doth <hi>alter</hi> and <hi>rectifie</hi> his Nature; ſo that if he doth readily obey the energy thereof, it muſt needs have ſuch an influence upon him, that to Sin <hi>Wilfully,</hi> is, as it were, <hi>againſt</hi> his <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Temper;</hi> and though it be not <hi>abſolutely,</hi> yet 'tis <hi>Morally</hi> impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for him to Act Preſumptuouſly; it goes againſt his Stomach, like a Doſe of Poyſon, which he cannot away with, but abhors the very thoughts of it. Now when a Man is thus diſpoſed, his Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is right, and he ought to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted with it, and to bleſs God for it: And though he finds himſelf lyable to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:48910:63"/>
many Infirmities, he ſhould not be caſt down ſo, as to conclude himſelf utterly unfit for the Communion; becauſe it is not in any Man's Power to be abſolutely perfect in this world. And beſides, there is a great deal of difference between <hi>Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities</hi> and Sins, if we ſpeak <hi>properly,</hi> and according to the Language and Senſe of the Holy Scriptures. For, as our Learned Paraphraſt hath well obſerved, to <hi>Sin,</hi> and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dr.</hi> Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, <hi>in</hi> 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 3. 8.</note> to <hi>commit Sin,</hi> and the like Phraſes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note a <hi>Deliberate, Preſumptuous,</hi> Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Sin; not to every Sin of Ignorance, incogitancy, or frailty; but Sins after deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, and adviſed Commiſſion of it. This is that which is meant, by letting Sin <hi>Reign</hi> in ones Body, by <hi>obeying</hi> it in the Luſts thereof, by <hi>yielding</hi> up ones Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers as Inſtruments of Unrighteouſneſs, by being the <hi>Servant of Sin,</hi> by <hi>fulfilling the</hi> Luſts of the Fleſh, by <hi>walking after the Fleſh,</hi> and the like Expreſſions, which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, not acts of Humane Infirmity, but Wickedneſs done with an <hi>high hand,</hi> and a <hi>ſtiff neck,</hi> and contrary to the Dictates of a Snubbing and Clamorous Conſcience, with the full Conſent and Approbation of a Froward Will. Such a courſe as this, every one is bound at his peril ſo to Repent of, as to relinquiſh and forſake it utterly, (as I ſhall ſhew hereafter.) But this is not
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48910:63"/>
the Caſe of a Good Man, who ſlips by Reaſon of meer <hi>Weakneſs,</hi> and who <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours</hi> and <hi>Groans</hi> under the Senſe of his manifold weakneſſes, and ſtrives daily to overcome them. His ſincere endeavours are accepted, although he cannot <hi>perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and <hi>totally</hi> overcome them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. TO ſpeak now more particularly in reference to thoſe ſeveral ſorts of Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which I have mentioned and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of before: Though they are but Infirmities, and ſuch too as are more or leſs unavoidable, yet 'tis to be remembred, that they are <hi>Sinful</hi> Infirmities; Sinful <hi>materially,</hi> and in ſome degree; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are not to be paſt by, without a <hi>ſuitable</hi> Repentance.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And firſt for that <hi>Sinful Inclination,</hi> which is in our common Nature: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was propagated and derived to us without our conſent, it muſt not remain in us with our liking or approbation; much leſs muſt it be ſerved with our willing compliance. No, our Repentance in this caſe muſt conſiſt in two things. 1. There muſt be a true <hi>Sorrow</hi> and <hi>Grief</hi> of Heart for this Evil Inclination, as the unhappy Original of all actual Sin. 2. This Sorrow muſt be improved into a <hi>ſtriving</hi> and <hi>ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> againſt our very ſelves; ſo that ſincere endeavours be uſed to check this byaſs of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48910:64"/>
Nature, which continually bends towards the wrong way. This may be done by ſeveral ways; as, by Reading of good Books, eſpecially the Holy Scriptures, and particularly our Saviour's Sermon on the Mount, and the ſad Hiſtory of his Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, enough of it ſelf, to correct a Man's Proneneſs to thoſe Sins, which did coſt the Redeemer of our Souls ſo dear: So likewiſe, by conſtant Prayer, by frequent Communion, by ſerious and Godly Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, by the diverſions of an Honeſt and Profitable Converſation; by having the Promiſes of God often in ones thoughts; by Contemplating daily upon the Glories and endleſs Felicities of another World; by due reflections upon the Nobleneſs of Virtue, and upon the Folly as well as Foulneſs of a baſe Action; by thinking upon ones latter end; and I muſt not omit to ſay too, by furniſhing ones Mind with ſound and Virtuous <hi>Principles.</hi> For there are many Principles in the World, which ſerve to <hi>Debauch,</hi> even the <hi>Depraved</hi> Nature of Mankind, rendring the Practice of Subſtantial Religion altogether <hi>unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,</hi> making Sin <hi>Venial,</hi> and turning Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, the G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>veſt thing in the World, into a meer empty Formality, I had almoſt ſaid, into a ludicrous piece of Craft and Traffick. Such Principles are ſo far from
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:48910:64"/>
                  <hi>mending</hi> Nature, that they make it worſe than they found it, and raiſe Mens incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations into a Career and Greedineſs after Vice, and into Luxurious Satisfactions in it; ſo that too great care cannot be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of ſeaſoning the Heart with <hi>wholſom</hi> and ſound Doctrine, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. That is, with ſuch Principles as are <hi>Sanatary of Nature, and Reſtoratives of Virtue,</hi> wherein the Life of Religion doth conſiſt. Now if a Man be diligent and careful to act after this manner, it is enough as to this point; for though he cannot wholly <hi>Conquer</hi> his Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet by theſe methods he will by degrees <hi>ſubdue</hi> them in a very great <hi>meaſure;</hi> ſo that though they ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue within him, they ſhall not hurt him, becauſe he doth all that is in his power to do; and he may be ſure, that what he cannot help, God will certainly Pardon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. MUCH to the ſame purpoſe we may ſay of thoſe <hi>Evil Thoughts,</hi> which are apt to break out upon the Mind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly, and unawares; they are ſo to be Repented of, as to be <hi>bewail'd</hi> and <hi>ſtifled</hi> with all poſſible <hi>ſpeed.</hi> For if they be <hi>moroſae delectationes,</hi> (as Caſuiſts are wont to ſpeak) <hi>cheriſh'd</hi> and <hi>indulged</hi> for ſome Pleaſure they bring along with them,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:48910:65"/>
then they become ſomewhat <hi>more</hi> than <hi>Infirmities.</hi> Though they are Involuntary in reſpect of their firſt <hi>ſtarting,</hi> yet they grow into <hi>Wilful</hi> Sins by that <hi>Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> which is conſented to, and uſually prove fatal in their Conſequence, and Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue; becauſe many times they are a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude to diſhoneſty, when opportunity ſerves: As Adultery in the Heart often breaks out into Adultery in the Eye; ſo that a Wiſe Man muſt deal with his Evil Thoughts, as a vigilant Governour doth with <hi>Rebels, Suppreſs and Diſſipate</hi> them as ſoon as poſſibly he can. The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods I have mentioned already are very proper in this Caſe alſo; and if a Man doth ſedulouſly apply himſelf to the uſe of them, though he will meet with ſome ſtruglings and difficulties in the Conflict, yet by degrees he will be a Conquerour: To be ſure, his hearty Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance will be rewarded as an act of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and Virtue. 'Tis this <hi>Reſiſtance</hi> of our own Evil Thoughts, that the God of Purity regards; and when the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them are thus reſiſted, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of them is gone, becauſe they are unwilful acts, that proceed from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible debility of Nature; nay many times from ſome inveterate Diſtemper in ones <hi>Body,</hi> which as naturally caſteth up
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48910:65"/>
ugly <hi>Idea's</hi> into the <hi>Brain</hi> and Fancy, as over moiſt <hi>Soyls</hi> caſt up Vapours and Fogs into the Air; and though for a while they bring a Cloud over ones Spirit, yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Experience ſhews, that the day breaks up again; and therefore he that is diſturbed with things of no greater mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than theſe, ought no more to be frighted from the Holy Communion, or dejected in his mind, than if he were ſick of the <hi>Spleen;</hi> there being ſuch a vaſt <hi>difference</hi> between Matters of <hi>this</hi> nature, and an <hi>Evil Conſcience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. THE other Particulars I ſhall bring under one common Conſideration, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſame things in a manner are to be ſaid of them all. As for thoſe invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary <hi>Omiſſions</hi> which the beſt Men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be ſenſible of, and thoſe <hi>mixtures</hi> of <hi>Imperfection</hi> which they find in their Nobleſt Actions; and thoſe irregularities to which the common frame and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Humanity makes us all ſubject; every Man ought, as to be humbled for them by a <hi>general</hi> Repentance, ſo to beg pardon for them in <hi>David</hi>'s Style; <hi>O cleanſe thou me from my ſecret faults,</hi> Pſal. 19. 12. So alſo to guard himſelf from them with that care and vigilance which becomes a Man of an honeſt and ſincere heart. This is certain, that if we do but
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48910:66"/>
ſecure our hearts unto God, he will ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure all his mercies to us. It is not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and ſpotleſs perfection he expects from us, but ſincerity, which is <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Perfection.</hi> As long as we are Men we ſhall be feeble, and as long as we are feeble, it cannot be but we muſt trip ſometimes, or tread a little awry, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially where our way is long, and the ground ſlippery. But if we do not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully turn aſide out of the right Path, nor fall, ſo as to Apoſtatiſe from the Truth, or caſt away our Righteouſneſs, ſuch is the Divine Goodneſs and Mercy that we ſhall not fall into <hi>Perdition.</hi> There <hi>is not a Righteous Man on the Earth that Sinneth not,</hi> Eccleſ. 7. 10. Bring in all the whole Army of Noble Saints and Martyrs, and you ſhall hear them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of their Infirmities. God gives us Grace ſufficient to enable us to maintain a Combate with the World, the Devil, and our own Luſts; but not ſo much as will gain us a perfect and entire Victory, ſo as to free us from all further Allarms, and Onſets. And indeed there is good Reaſon why we ſhould not be unexerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Temptations; that we may not be Proud. As God left the <hi>Canaanites</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> to humble, and to try them; ſo doth he leave our Infirmities in us,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48910:66"/>
even when he gives us the Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that he may make us ſenſible of our failings, and lay us in the duſt under the ſenſe of them; ſo that the ſetting of a Crown upon our heads, may be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd to be an act of his free Grace, and that we may Triumph in the Name of God alone, who hath <hi>concluded all under Sin, that he may have Mercy on all.</hi> By reaſon of theſe Infirmities we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to <hi>Watch;</hi> which is a plain ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that we are ſtill in <hi>danger</hi> of being aſſaulted, and our moſt treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Enemies may be thoſe of our own Houſhold. Now what we cannot <hi>avoid,</hi> by the Mercies of God we ſhall not be <hi>accountable</hi> for: But our Frailties and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, if they be <hi>acknowledg'd,</hi> and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail'd,</hi> and <hi>prayed againſt,</hi> and <hi>ſtrugled with,</hi> are Pardoned of courſe; and every Man is <hi>accepted according to that which he hath, and not according to that he hath not,</hi> 2 Cor. 8. 12. Chriſtianity is neither a ſoft Pillow for Wicked Men to ſleep on, nor yet a weary yoak for Good Men to ſink under; there being in the Goſpel ſuch an admirable mixture of the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes with the Threats; that as a vicious Wretch has no reaſon to preſume, ſo a Sincere and Humble hearted Man hath no
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48910:67"/>
reaſon to <hi>Deſpair. Thou Lord art Merciful,</hi> faith the Pſalmiſt; <hi>for thou rewardeſt every Man according to his Works:</hi> And it is the <hi>uſual</hi> Courſe and Tenour of a Man's Life, that God doth judge of him by, making a great <hi>abatement</hi> for his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Infirmities; and were it not thus, no Fleſh living could be Saved; becauſe our preſent ſtate of imperfection will not ſuffer us to be without <hi>all manner</hi> of ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh; and he that boaſteth of abſolute Perfection, is not more a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> than a <hi>Fool;</hi> becauſe <hi>in many things we are apt to offend all.</hi> But every Sin grieveth not the good Spirit of God, nor is every Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence inconſiſtent with a State of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; nor doth every little tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion diſ-entitle us to the Divine Favour. The daily Sacrifice of the Heart in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the conſtant ſtriving with our manifold Infirmities, do ſo effectually O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate through the Merits of Chriſt, <hi>who died even for weak ones,</hi> that an Act of Frailty is not a Sin armed with a <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> Power. Though there be ſomething of the Viper in us, yet as long as we do not <hi>Cheriſh,</hi> or <hi>Indulge,</hi> or keep it <hi>warm</hi> in our boſom, it cannot <hi>Hurt,</hi> however it may <hi>fright</hi> us, and create in us ſome trouble and <hi>horrour.</hi> And ſo much be
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48910:67"/>
ſpoken of Sins of <hi>Infirmities,</hi> and of thoſe degrees of Repentance which are neceſſary for them.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>Of Wilful Sins.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I PROCEED next to Diſcourſe of Sins of <hi>Wilfulneſs;</hi> that nothing may eſcape us which is neceſſary to be known, in order to a full underſtanding of that Repentance which is to be preparatory to the Holy Communion. Now <hi>Wilful</hi> Sins are ſuch as are <hi>Adviſedly</hi> and of <hi>ſet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe</hi> committed; when a Man conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately doth this or that Evil action, either for his pleaſure, or for his profit ſake, or upon any other ſuch unreaſonable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements. And theſe Sins are of two ſorts, <hi>Habitual,</hi> or <hi>Occaſional. Habitual</hi> Sins are ſuch as are the general <hi>Tenor</hi> and <hi>Courſe</hi> of ones Life; which he <hi>allows</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in, and gives himſelf up to, and uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follows as his common Trade and <hi>Way.</hi> As, when ill Men <hi>accuſtom</hi> themſelves to Prophane the Holy Name of God, or
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48910:68"/>
                  <hi>addict</hi> themſelves to Drunkenneſs, or follow a Laſcivious and luſtful kind of Life; or make Fraud and Cheating a great part of their Trades; or live in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and Uncharitableneſs, or whatever other ſorts of Wickedneſs they ſuffer themſelves to <hi>Continue</hi> in. <hi>Theſe</hi> muſt needs be <hi>Wilful</hi> Habits, becauſe it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to conceive how any Man can perſiſt in ſuch Courſes, having ſo much Time and Leiſure to conſider of them, and not give his full <hi>conſent</hi> to ſuch Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties. For if it be ſaid (though 'tis ſtrange it ſhould) that the Man may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve theſe things to be Lawful, and ſo Labour under an Erroneous Judgment, which allows him in ſuch actions; yet it cannot be any thing but his own <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy</hi> that <hi>miſleads</hi> his Conſcience into ſuch an Errour, the Crime being ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent to common Reaſon. Or, if he acts contrary to his judgment (which is moſt likely) it is a Sin againſt Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which is the <hi>Higheſt</hi> aggravation any action is capable of: So that let him palliate it as he can, it is undoubtedly a <hi>Wilful Habit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And becauſe it is ſo, ſuch a <hi>Repentance</hi> is neceſſary, as changeth the <hi>whole frame</hi> of his Heart and Life; ſuch a Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as makes a Man lay aſide <hi>utterly</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:48910:68"/>
every vicious <hi>Cuſtom;</hi> ſuch a Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as effectually bends his Mind to an entire Practice of Virtue and Religion. For, the great buſineſs of Religion being to transform every one into the <hi>Divine Image, to make him Partaker of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature,</hi> and to render him, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Capacities of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Holy and Pure as God himſelf is; and <hi>ſorrow</hi> for what is paſt, being the firſt <hi>Beginning</hi> of ſuch a God-like Life: That Repentance muſt needs be Trifling and Impertinent, which doth not powerfully carry on thoſe Divine Purpoſes; and 'tis as impoſſible for one that perſiſts in an Evil State and Courſe, to be a true Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent at the ſame time, as it is to make Hell and Heaven meet together in one. Repentance is an High and Noble act of the Mind, that doth not lye in Sobs and Groans, nor meerly in the Anguiſh and Throws of a Spirit that is upon the Rack; for notwithſtanding all this, Guilt and the Love of Sin may be at the bottom; and inward torment may proceed purely from a preſent apprehenſion of vengeance, which every Man would willingly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void, though he delights in that which brings it upon him. No; Repentance that is genuine, works a total Change, turns the Deſires towards the Glory of God,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:48910:69"/>
which is the True and Proper Object of the Mind, and ſo by degrees improves and raiſeth up the depraved Nature of Man to thoſe perfections which are in God, of whoſe Glory thoſe Divine Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which Religion propoſeth to our practice, are a <hi>Copy and Tranſcript.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>INFINITELY diſtant from this, is the Life of that Man, who Loves to wallow in Vice, Senſuality, and Corruption. Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this ſort and Temper, are ſo far from having a right to the Promiſes of Pardon and Peace, which are tendred by the Evangelical Covenant, and which are Sealed at the Holy Sacrament, that the Scripture plainly threatens <hi>Indignation and Wrath, Tribulation and Anguiſh to every Soul that worketh Evil</hi> after this manner; to ſuch as <hi>obey <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs,</hi> to ſuch as are the <hi>Servants of Sin,</hi> to ſuch as let <hi>Sin reign in their Mortal Bodies,</hi> to ſuch as <hi>yield themſelves up to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs,</hi> to ſuch as make Proviſion <hi>for the Fleſh,</hi> to ſuch as <hi>obey it in the Luſts thereof,</hi> to ſuch as <hi>walk on in darkneſs,</hi> and <hi>lye in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs;</hi> and <hi>conform themſelves to this world;</hi> by all which Expreſſions, and many more to the ſame purpoſe, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture meaneth ſuch as continue and perſiſt in an Ungodly <hi>courſe,</hi> in a crooked <hi>way,</hi> in a vicious <hi>Manner and Habit of Life.</hi> For
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48910:69"/>
which Reaſon, when Men intend to go to the Holy Communion, (where every one is ſure to receive ſomething, either Mercy, or Judgment to himſelf) they ſhould take themſelves to a very ſtrict account, and impartially obſerve what that way is, wherein they are uſed to go: And if they find themſelves ſo ill given, as that they willingly follow their own hearts Luſts, and reſolve to do ſo ſtill, in ſpight of God's Word, and the checks of their own Conſciences, they muſt not in any wiſe preſent themſelves at the Lord's Table, but utterly forbear, 'till they have truly humbled themſelves under ſuch a ſenſe of their impieties, as worketh that Repentance which is the entrance upon a Life of Virtue, and True Religion. If there be not this Divine diſpoſition of Soul in them, they are no more fit to receive the Body of Chriſt, than <hi>Judas</hi> that Betrayed him, or <hi>Pilate</hi> that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him, or the <hi>Jews</hi> that Mock'd him, or the Souldier that ſtuck a Spear into his Side. And if he goes to the Holy Sacrament, while he goes on ſtill in his wickedneſs, he doth but take a large ſtep towards his own deſtruction. Such a one deſpiſeth the Sufferings of the Son of God, tramples the Blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant under his feet, and accounteth it an
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48910:70"/>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nholy Thing,</hi> as if it were a refreſhment for a Beaſt; and he is like one, that brings a Swine into the Sanctuary to feed upon the Bread of Eternal Life. Therefore, before we Celebrate ſo Great a Myſtery, we are to enter into the ſtricteſt Engagements, to bind our Souls with the moſt ſerious Vows, and to ſet up very ſtrong and powerful Reſolutions of Amendment, leſt in making too great haſte to ſo Divine and Solemn an Ordinance, we make haſte to Periſh, and to be Undone. For nothing makes us capable, without Repentance from dead Works; as <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Juſtin Mart.</hi> Apol. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> ſaid. <hi>The food at the Euchariſt is not lawful to be received but by ſuch as believe the Doctrines of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity to be true; and have been waſh'd in the Laver of Regeneration, and lead their Lives according to Chriſt's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions.</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Habentem adhuc vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatem peccandi gravari magis dico Euchariſtiae per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptione, quam purificari, S.</hi> Aug. de Eccleſ.

               <p>Here a Queſtion may ariſe, whether it be Lawful for one to Communicate upon ſerious <hi>Vows</hi> and <hi>Reſolutions</hi> only? That
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48910:70"/>
is, before he has tryed the ſtrength and efficacy of them? For it is poſſible for a Man who has led a diſſolute Life, to be through the piercing Power of the Word of God, ſtruck ſo on a ſudden into the Senſe of his Guilt and Danger, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve and undertake <hi>preſently</hi> to forſake his Impieties. And perhaps too his outward circumſtances may be ſuch, that if he miſſeth the opportunity he hath now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, he may be in a very great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of not meeting with another. In which particular caſe, I know no Reaſon ſufficient to debar him from the uſe of this Ordinance, which effectually gives the Benefits of our Saviour's Paſſion to every true Penitent, as our Saviour himſelf gave them to that Thief upon the Croſs, who was Converted in a moment. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, where Men ſeem not to be ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in their circumſtances, but have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably time before them to make ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of their Reſolutions, it is very expedient for them to betake themſelves to their Retirements, to weep bitterly, to obſerve what ground they are able to gain of their Habitual Vices, what Victory they get over their own Hearts, by ſuitable Acts of Mortification and Self-denyal, which are neceſſary to be undertaken for the eradicating of inveterate Habits. By
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48910:71"/>
theſe means they will afterwards come to the Bleſſed Sacrament with better advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, becauſe with more Comfort, with more Confidence and Peace of Mind, than ſuch as have not made any <hi>Tryal</hi> of the firmneſs and ſtedfaſtneſs of their Vows and Reſolutions. And yet I do not know, but even theſe may come with <hi>Safety;</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if (as I ſaid) they find themſelves ſtraitned in their Circumſtances, and verily believe their Reſolution to be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in it ſelf, and ſuch as will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of Good Fruits. For all perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance doth ſuppoſe a <hi>Beginning,</hi> and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued State of Repentance is founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome foregoing <hi>Acts;</hi> and the very firſt act of Repentance begins and works in the <hi>Mind;</hi> ſo that if <hi>that</hi> be ſincere and genuine, there is no doubt but 'tis very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable with God. But becauſe the proof of this Sincerity depends upon Experience, and 'tis no eaſie thing, to skip in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from a courſe of Immorality, to a Life of Holineſs, 'tis neceſſary for Men to uſe all poſſible means to approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to God and their own Conſciences, before they preſume to Eat of this Bread, and to Drink of this Wine. And ſo much ſhall ſuffice to be ſpoken of Repentance, from ſuch Sins as are habitual.</p>

2. THE <hi>other</hi> ſorts of <hi>Wilful Sins,</hi> I call <hi>Occaſional;</hi> becauſe they are not a ſetled Trade, but the <hi>contingent</hi> Effects of ſome <hi>emergent</hi> and <hi>occaſional</hi> Temptation, which a fooliſh and negligent Wretch doth not exert his Strength and Courage to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, nor perhaps endeavours to reſiſt, by Reaſon of ſome baſe advantages which are offer'd him upon his Wicked <hi>Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</hi> A Man whoſe Life is unblameable in reſpect of its uſual tenour and courſe, may fall in ſome ſingle inſtances, and that deliberately; witneſs King <hi>David;</hi> whom the Scripture gives a great Character of as to the main; and yet we know how miſerably he Sinned, firſt in the Caſe of <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> whoſe Embraces he longed after ſo paſſionately, though he knew the thing to have been moſt plainly forbidden by the expreſs Law of God: And then in the Caſe of her Husband <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah;</hi> a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Subject, that had ſo merited of him by the moſt Eminent Services; and yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would ſatisfie <hi>David</hi> at laſt, but <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi>'s Ruine; an horrible Sin againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expreſs Law of God; and to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate it, a Sin which he brought about after the baſeſt manner, by Diſſimulation, Hypocriſie, Perfidiouſneſs, and in cold Blood too, and with all the Deliberation that uſually attends ſuch Politick but Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:48910:72"/>
Artifices. I call theſe <hi>Wilful</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional Wickedneſſes, becauſe they were done with his Conſent, and he became voluntarily Guilty of them upon ſome ſpecial Emergencies. And of the ſame Nature are thoſe Wickedneſſes, which are acted by Perſons, who are in other inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Men of a fair Reputation, and of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably good Conſciences; and yet for ſome Carnal or Worldly ends, do baſely yield themſelves up by occaſion of ſome Occurrences, to commit ſuch Iniquities, as make the World to ring, and all but themſelves to be aſham'd of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ESTIONLESS</hi> ſuch Sins as theſe, are both for the <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> of them, of a very Criminal Nature, and a very deep Die, and therefore ſtand in need of a very deep Repentance, if God peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhall grant it, for the recovery of ſuch Men out of the Snare of the Devil. For ſuch Impieties as theſe, though but occaſional ones, do ſtrangely waſte and make havock of the Conſcience, make the Heart callous and cruſty, are vocal and obſtreperous, crying aloud to Heaven for Vengeance, <hi>Grieve</hi> the Good Spirit of God, and if not throughly and timely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, by degrees <hi>quench</hi> him; they are horribly Scandalous to Religion, Injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the Intereſts of Mankind, and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:48910:72"/>
becauſe they are done deliberately and of ſet purpoſe, are very high Affronts and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelies to God himſelf. Nor will it mend the matter to pretend, that they do theſe things with a great deal of reluctancy; for it cannot be otherwiſe, if Men have any Senſe of God and of their Duty, and have any thing of Conſcience left them, that is not quite ſeared and paſt feeling. Conſcience will recoil, though it be never ſo ſmother'd or drown'd; and the Sin the greater ſtill, becauſe acted againſt Conſcience; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of Conſcience, argues the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt it, to be the ſtronger and the more violent, and conſequently renders the act it ſelf, the more Malicious and Deadly.</p>
               <p>THEREFORE, before ſuch Men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to go to the Bleſſed Sacrament, it vaſtly concerns them to make their Peace with God, with their own Conſciences, and with the World too, by a pungent and proportionable Repentance. For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, their caſe is equally as bad and dangerous, as the moſt habitual Offenders; Repentance from dead works, being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually preſcribed unto all. Nor will it be ſo much conſider'd in the dreadful day of Judgment, who Sinn'd <hi>oftneſt;</hi> for if a Man be an <hi>hardned</hi> Wretch, let his Sins be many or few, Habitual or Occaſional,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48910:73"/>
his <hi>Impenitence</hi> muſt neceſſarily throw him into a place of Everlaſting Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>NOW that Repentance for theſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional Wickedneſſes may be adequate and full, it muſt have, as I conceive, theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Qualifications, with which I ſhall conclude this Subject. 1. It muſt be as ſpeedy as 'tis poſſible. For if notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the inward motions of God's Spirit, and the importunities of a Man's own Conſcience, he puts his Repentance off, what is this but a plain <hi>Approbation</hi> of what he did? Which approbation <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing,</hi> the Sin becomes <hi>Habitual,</hi> though it was a <hi>ſingle</hi> act, and though you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it to have been the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>only</hi> Sin of his whole Life; though it be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, yet, not being Repented of, it is <hi>Belov'd,</hi> which is the ſame thing in God's Account, as if it were acted over and over again. For which Reaſon it cometh to paſs by the juſt Judgment of God, that one Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional Wickedneſs Unrepented of, doth ſometimes by degrees and delay harden the Heart ſtrangely, and emboldens the Man to go on; ſo that having once Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated his Conſcience preſumptuouſly, he ſticks not to violate and wound it ſtill. And thus one Wickedneſs draws on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: God delivering him up to himſelf,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48910:73"/>
for his firſt <hi>Preſumption</hi> and ſubſequent <hi>Impenitence,</hi> the Wretch runs on headlong, till his Conſcience proves Deaf, and his Caſe becomes very deplorable; like ſome obſtinate Fools, that having made but one falſe ſtep, purſue their Error, and trudge forward through thick and thin, having not the Heart to retreat, though there be a fatal Precipice before them: And thus the Man breaks his Neck in the end, and falls into Ruine, which at firſt he did not foreſee, or ſuſpect; and all by means of one Occaſional Wickedneſs not retracted, not Repented of in time. 2. This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance ought to be not only ſpeedy, but alſo <hi>vigorous, extenſive,</hi> and <hi>commenſurate</hi> to the Sin. For, as it was preſumptuous in the Commiſſion, ſo in reſpect of its <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances</hi> and manifold Enormity, it may be exceeding ſinful. Perhaps it was acted by one whoſe <hi>Place, Office,</hi> and <hi>Dignity,</hi> renders it the more <hi>open,</hi> the more <hi>foul,</hi> and the more <hi>Infectious.</hi> Perhaps it was a <hi>Complicated</hi> Sin, againſt God, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Men too; an Act of Impiety, and of Injuſtice and Oppreſſion. Perhaps it was highly <hi>Scandalous,</hi> an encouragement to thouſands of others to do the like, a great reproach to Religion, and that whereby the Word of God is Blaſphemed or evil ſpoken of. A great many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:48910:74"/>
there are which may attend the Fact, to aggravate and heighten it; and accordingly the Malefactor's Repentance muſt bear a proportion to the ſeveral Branches into which it ſpreads. There are required great Humiliations and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of Soul to implore God's Mercy; a deep remorſe and anguiſh to propitiate his own Conſcience, a through deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sin it ſelf, many acts of ſelf revenge for having complyed with the Temptation; and if the Sin be injurious to others, all poſſible Reparation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution muſt be made to the injur'd Party; for the Laws of God have equally provided for the intereſts of all men; and for an Oppreſſor, or any other Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Perſon to pretend ſorrow without making amends for his Injuſtice, is the ſame thing as if he ſhould Plunder and Sequeſter his Neighbour, and then ſay he Repents, though with the ſame In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice he keeps at the ſame time the Mammon of Unrighteouſneſs in his Clut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
               <p>3. THERE is required alſo for all Wilful Occaſional Tranſgreſſions, ſuch a ſtrong Repentance, as makes a Man to be very jealous of himſelf, to be very watchful and circumſpect for the <hi>future;</hi> to ſtand ſtrictly upon his Guard, to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48910:74"/>
of the Temptation, to beware of coming near it, or near the occaſion of it: Briefly, to give all Moral Diligence, that now he ſtands upon his Legs, and in the favour of God again, he may not fall the <hi>Second</hi> time. It is a dangerous thing to be within the reach of a Temptation, to be within the hearing of the Devil's Propoſals. <hi>All theſe Things will I give thee,</hi> if in this ſingle inſtance thou wilt reſign up thy Conſcience, and fall down and Worſhip me. 'Tis <hi>dangerous,</hi> I ſay, becauſe in ſuch a Caſe a Man is under a neceſſity, either to venture his ruine by Compliance, or to uſe his utmoſt Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to Conquer the Temptation; which becauſe many do not, but rather Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change their Conſciences, as a Price and Compoſition for ſome preſent advantages; therefore 'tis very neceſſary for ſuch as did once make ſuch a bad bargain, to keep hereafter out of harms way. For he that Loves the Temptation, cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to diſlike the Sin; but Sin he will again, even for a morſel of Bread, if he be but Sollicited; and therefore that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance muſt needs be counterfeit and Hypocritical, when a Man is ſorry only becauſe he wants <hi>Encouragements</hi> to be wicked.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:48910:75"/>
4 SUCH Repentance is neceſſary, as is attended with a firm and ſturdy <hi>Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi> to be truly Honeſt and Upright all the days of ones Life. Such an Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and Manly Reſolution is by the Grace of God ſufficient alone to carry a Man ſafe out, through the midſt of a thouſand Dangers. For either he will not be Tempted at all, eſpecially when the firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Mind and Temper is diſcover'd, (the Devil himſelf will not eaſily throw away his Baits upon thoſe he finds In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible) or elſe he will have Courage e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to reſiſt all beginnings of Evil, leſt by yielding, though it be but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, he ſhould be enſnared (as commonly Men are) into direct <hi>Engagements</hi> to Wickedneſs. It is a moſt dreadful thing to be <hi>Engaged</hi> to work Iniquity, to be under a ſort of neceſſity to do it, and to be involved in guilt to that degree, as if he were forced as it were to go on fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtill, as if one had no other ſeeming Security but to puſh forward, and now to work that Iniquity with <hi>Greedineſs,</hi> which at firſt was only propoſed to his <hi>Choice.</hi> Yet this is the Devil's way to make himſelf ſure of Mens Partnerſhip with him in his Torments; firſt to lead them into a willingneſs of ſubmitting to his Conduct, and then, when once he has
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:48910:75"/>
them under the whip-hand, to drive them into Perdition. And with none doth he ſo eaſily prevail, as with People of unreſolved Minds, of mean, pliant, and eaſie Tempers; by means whereof, he drills them on into ſuch a courſe of Impiety, that they know not well where or how to ſtay their foot. A Man of Reſolution eaſily prevents this miſchief, by generouſly reſiſting the very firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of Evil; nor would any be perſwaded to act that to day, which yeſterday he was Troubled at, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of; did he but arm himſelf with a ſtrong and powerful <hi>Reſolution</hi> never to do ſo more.</p>
               <p>TO theſe might be added ſeveral things more, to ſhew what Repentance that is to be, and to what degrees it muſt reach, which is neceſſary to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Man from the guilt and power, as well of all Habitual, as of all Occaſional Sins that are deliberately committed. But I ſuppoſe what hath been ſaid already is enough; and <hi>the ſhort</hi> of the matter is <hi>this,</hi> that God delights in nothing more than in a Man's innocence; and if through Folly or Deſign a Man hath caſt it away, he hath no other way left him, but as far as poſſibly he can, to <hi>Regain</hi> it by ſuch a <hi>Sincere, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal,</hi> and <hi>Stedfaſt</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:48910:76"/>
as will be apt to make him live up to the Precepts of Chriſts Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and to expreſs in ſome meaſure a reſemblanee of thoſe Divine Perfections which are in God himſelf.</p>
               <p>And never is this more neceſſary, than when we prepare for the Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, where the memory of Chriſt's Suffering for Sin is Celebrated, where Pardon of Sin is ſolemnly prayed for; where that, and all other Benefits of our Saviour's Paſſion are verily and indeed offered, and where we profeſs to offer <hi>and preſent our Selves, our Souls and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, to be a Reaſonable, Holy, and Lively Sacrifice unto God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'TIS not a few Trifles that can fit you for this <hi>Solemnity?</hi> 'Tis not going bare-foot, or lying upon the ground, or the putting on uneaſie Apparel, or Scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the Fleſh; 'tis not thumping of the Breaſt, or abſtinence from certain ſorts of Meat, or a few Sighs and Tears flowing from a little ſence of Sin, and from a great fear of Hell; nay, 'tis not the Abſolution of the Church (though that be a Sacred Thing, and where peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are rightly diſpoſed, an effectual Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, and ſuch as we uſe too; 'tis not this neither) that can <hi>prepare</hi> you ſufficiently for the Worthy eating of the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:48910:76"/>
Bread, and drinking of the Cup, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Broken Heart, without a Change of Mind, without full purpoſe and Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to mend your Lives, and to ſerve God in true Holineſs and Righteouſneſs all you days. For this is the true end and Scope of Chriſt's Religion, without the Practice whereof, all outward Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances are but ſorry and empty Formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; things which are very conſiſtent with a Life of Sin (though that be the great thing which Chriſt came into the World, and dyed upon the Croſs, that he might deſtroy) nor do I ſee by the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of ſome Men, how any of thoſe External Rites can lay the leaſt reſtraint upon our Vices and Luſts; but muſt be rather Encouragements to all manner of Sin and Wickedneſs; it being ſuch a ſtrong Temptation to Men to run pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently upon a new Score, after the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is over; when they believe that all their accounts may be wiped out by thoſe mean and eaſie methods, which reach not the Heart, nor meddle with Luſts, but let all manner of inward im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities alone, though thoſe be the great things which God is angry at.</p>
               <p>EXTERNAL Penance is one thing, but the Repentance of the Heart, and the Mortification of the Spirit is another,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48910:77"/>
and a far different Matter; and that which infinitely more deſerves our ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt regard; for it is the Original of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Temper, and of a Life that is truly Chriſtian. And I have been the more Copious in Diſcourſing upon it; not only becauſe it is a neceſſary Preparative to this Heavenly Myſtery, but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the great buſineſs of our whole Life; 'tis the root of all Religion, out of which ſpring all thoſe particular and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious branches of Godlineſs, Righteouſneſs, and Sobriety, which together make up the whole Duty of Man, and are the Genuine and Salutary Fruits of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>

thoſe for whom <hi>Chriſt dyed.</hi> It is the Apoſtles own inference, 1 Joh. 4. 11. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, if God ſo Loved us, we ought alſo to Love one another.</hi> In Diſcourſing upon this Point, I am to ſpeak, 1. Of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; 2. Of the Exerciſe of Charity.</p>
               <p n="1">1. AS to its Nature; Charity is a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of vaſt Extent and Latitude, ſo that St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it <hi>the fulfilling of the Law,</hi> Rom. 13. Tho' the vulgar ſort are apt to reſtrain it to <hi>Alms-deeds;</hi> yet that is but one <hi>Branch</hi> of Charity, nay, when 'tis done out of Oſtentation, and for Popular applauſe, it loſeth the Reward, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves not the very <hi>Name</hi> of Charity, as we find by the Apoſtle, where he tells us, that <hi>though I beſtow all my goods to feed the Poor, yet if I have not Charity, it profiteth me nothing,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. In which Chapter, we have a large deſcription of Charity, that it <hi>ſuffereth long, and is kind,</hi> that it <hi>Enviet not,</hi> that it <hi>vaunteth not it ſelf,</hi> that <hi>it is not puffed up,</hi> that <hi>it behaveth not it ſelf unſeemly,</hi> that <hi>it ſeeketh not her own,</hi> that <hi>it is not eaſily provoked,</hi> that <hi>it thinketh no evil,</hi> that <hi>it rejoyceth not in iniquity,</hi> but <hi>rejoyceth in the Truth;</hi> that <hi>it beareth all Things, believeth all Things, hopeth all Things, endureth all Things.</hi> By which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Expreſſions is meant, that true Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity hath ſuch an Univerſal influence
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48910:78"/>
upon a Man's Mind, that it creates in him an entire Goodneſs and Lovelineſs of Nature, and reſtrains him from every thing that is either inhumane, or inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, or unbecoming the temper of one that profeſſeth himſelf a Diſciple of the Meek, Humble, and Beneficent Jeſus. Therefore before you go to the Lord's Table, you ſhould examine and look into your Temper, and endeavour to rectifie it, wherever any crookedneſs appears, wherever it croſſeth the Chriſtian Law, wherever it ſwerves from that Divine Nature and Spirit which was in the great Exemplar of Charity. People that are impatient of every little provocation; that are rough, uncompaſſionate, inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of other Men's Miſeries; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grudge any good which the providence of God caſteth into their Neighbour's bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; that out of a Towring and Lofty Conceit of their own Merits, look con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly and ſpightfully down upon their Brethren; that are intractable, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly, and purſue only their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſatisfaction; that are full of rancour and malice; that employ their minds upon wicked and miſchievous Contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; that take pleaſure in the Sins or Frailties of others; that inſtead of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and concealing them, ſpread the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:48910:78"/>
of them abroad, and proclaim them as it were from the Houſe top; that are prone to believe any thing that is Evil of thoſe they have no kindneſs for; to judge the worſt of them, to turn every thing they do to a hard Conſtruction, and to treat them ſo as if they were no other than Reprobates, and Caſt-aways: People I ſay, of this harſh and ſower diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, ſhould new-mould their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers before they come to the Supper of the Lamb, which was Meek, Innocent, and Spotleſs, and which readily offer'd up himſelf a Sacrifice and Atonement for the Crimes of the whole World. <hi>Purge out therefore the old Leaven,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>that ye may be a new Lump; for even Chriſt our Paſſeover is Sacrificed for us; therefore let us keep the Feaſt, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and Wickedneſs, but with the unlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened Bread of Purity and Truth,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 7, 8.</p>
               <p>But there are two ſpecial acts of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which I am more particularly to ſpeak of, becauſe there are at this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity ſome <hi>Special</hi> Reaſons for them; ſome ſpecial Conſiderations to ſtir us up to the exerciſe of them, and to ſingle them out particularly from the reſt; and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:48910:79"/>
they are. 1. <hi>Liberality to the Poor.</hi> 2. <hi>Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Forgiveneſs.</hi>

                     <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> Apol. 2.</note> The like Cuſtom was in the Chriſtian Churches, (as <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> tells us) in the very next Age to the Apoſtles, of ſending ſome of the Conſecrated <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> to ſuch Chriſtians as were abſent; which makes me ſtill believe, that the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians look'd upon this Sacred Solemnity as <hi>Analagous</hi> to thoſe <hi>Sacrifical Feaſts</hi> which had been uſed all the World over. In this there ſeems to be a great difference; that among the <hi>Pagans</hi> diſtribution was made to their <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Relations</hi> only; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Charity of Chriſt's Diſciples was not limited, but extended unto <hi>all</hi> that were neceſſitous, though they were more eſpecially regarded, who were of the <hi>Houſhold of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS kind of Charity to our Fellow-Creatures, God who extendeth his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to all his works, hath ſtill required of Mankind, and more abundantly ſince he hath ſent his Son to us, which was
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48910:79"/>
the moſt Eminent inſtance of his own ſincere Love and Goodneſs to the whole World. How many <hi>Commands</hi> do we find in the New Teſtament, <hi>to be Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, as our Heavenly Father is Merciful;</hi> to <hi>lay up our Treaſures in Heaven;</hi> to <hi>do Good;</hi> to <hi>be ready to give; to be glad to diſtribute; to be Rich in good works,</hi> and the like? But at the Bleſſed Euchariſt we are more eſpecially concern'd to be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of this matter, becauſe there are more eſpecial Conſiderations to excite us to it; for here we commemorate the Charity of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that <hi>though he was Rich, yet for our ſakes he became Poor, that we through his Poverty might be Rich,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 9. Here we ſee how he parted with his Heart-blood, and laid down his very Life for us. And here he feeds us with Food from Heaven, with that Divine and Spiritual nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereof the Manna in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs was a poor <hi>Type</hi> and <hi>Figure;</hi> with the true Bread of Life; with his Fleſh which is <hi>Meat indeed,</hi> and with his Blood which is <hi>drink indeed;</hi> more ſtrengthning than the Manna, more efficacious, more durable; for he that partaketh hereof ſhall <hi>Live for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. THESE Conſiderations do of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Naturally tend to ſtir us all up to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:48910:80"/>
theſe acts of Mercy and Charity at this time. A thing ſo Univerſally, ſo Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly obſerved by all Chriſtian Churches ſince the beginning of Chriſtianity, that we cannot ſhew any one Age when this Bleſſed Sacrament was ever adminiſtred without it; perhaps it is the only Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Right, which hath come down to us without any contradiction; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the thing may be of ſome conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable uſe and ſatisfaction, I ſhall give this ſhort account of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. OUR Saviour in his Sermon on the Mount had ſaid, <hi>If thou bring thy Gift to the Altar, and there remembreſt that thy Brother hath ought againſt thee, leave there thy Gift before the Altar, and go thy way, firſt be reconciled to thy Brother, and then come and offer thy Gift,</hi> Mat. 5. 23, 24. The Primitive Chriſtians underſtood theſe words to have been ſpoken by way of Anticipation, with reſpect to that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which all were to expreſs at this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>See Mr.</hi> Mead<hi>'s Learned Diſcourſe of the Altar.</hi>
                  </note> Becauſe all Legal Sacrifices were now in a ſhort time utterly to ceaſe; they could not conceive why our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſhould preſcribe a <hi>New</hi> Right and Duty to be uſed at the preſenting of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Oblations, and that in a Sermon which he purpoſely intended for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual and ſtanding uſe of his own
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48910:80"/>
Church; and therefore they lookt upon it as a ſtanding Law, which he gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally, and <hi>before-hand,</hi> to oblige all his Followers to acts of Charity, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when they come to his own Table. Hereupon aroſe two Cuſtoms, which all Chriſtians univerſally obſerved in the Primitive Ages, and which had no other plain Text of Scripture in all the New Teſtament to warrant them, but this Text only. One was in token of their mutual <hi>Reconciliation</hi> and ſincere Love, for as they were going to Celebrate this Divine Myſtery, the Deacon cryed aloud to this purpoſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Let no Man have a quarrel againſt any;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Devout Communicants pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently Saluted one another with an <hi>Holy Kiſs.</hi> The other Cuſtom was what I am now ſpeaking of, of providing for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of the Poor. None came before the Altar with empty hands, but every one according to his abilities brought ſomething to be offer'd upon the Holy Table for the uſe of their indigent Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; part of the Offerings being firſt Conſecrated for the Celebration of the preſent Solemnity; and theſe they called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Holy Gifts, according to our Saviour's Language.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:48910:81"/>
WHICH Cuſtom was undoubtedly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved even in the Apoſtles time; as you may ſee by theſe Proofs. 1. Firſt ſaith St. <hi>Paul, upon the firſt day of the week let every one of you lay by him in ſtore, as God hath proſpered him,</hi> 1 Cor. 16. 2. Though the Apoſtle here ſpake directly and chiefly of a ſpecial Collection which was then to be made for the poor Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in <hi>Judea,</hi> yet becauſe he directed the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to lay by ſomething in ſtore upon the <hi>firſt day</hi> of the week, the day on which the Holy Sacrament was conſtantly adminiſtred in the Apoſtles time, it ſeems highly propable that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake of an <hi>Accumulation</hi> of Charity, over and above the ordinary proportion which they were wont on that day to preſent before the Lord's Table.</p>
               <p n="2">2. BUT there is another paſſage of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, and that in the very ſame E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> which puts the thing out of all Controverſie; 1 Cor. 11. 20, 21, 22. <hi>When ye come together in one place, this is not to eat the Lord's Supper; for in eating every one taketh before other his own Supper, and one is Hungry, and another is Drunken. What, have ye not Houſes to eat and to drink in? or deſpiſe ye the Church of God? and ſhame them that have not?</hi> Here the Apoſtle expreſly ſpeaks of eating the

Lord's Supper, and that in the Church, the <hi>Place</hi> of Publick Religious Aſſemblies, which he plainly diſtinguiſheth from their <hi>Private</hi> Houſe; and he blames them for thoſe Diſorders, and profane extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies they committed in the Church at that time; and I will repreſent the Caſe in the words of our Learned and Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Paraphraſt Dr. <hi>Hammond. Thoſe Publick Common Meetings which ſhould have been as at the Table of the Lord, to eat a Church-meal, a common Chriſtian Feaſt, were made by thoſe</hi> Corinthians <hi>much otherwiſe, none of that Communicativeneſs and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was among them, as was required in Such. For at their Feaſts of Charity, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying, the Lord's Supper, which were intended for the relief of the Poor, and wherein all the Gueſts were to be equal, no Man to take place, or eat before another, no Man to pretend any right to what he brought, but every Man to contribute to the common Table, and to eat in common with all others; this Cuſtom was utterly broken among them, he that brought a great deal, fell to that, as if it were in his own Houſe, at his own meal, and ſo fed to the full; whereas a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, which was not able to bring ſo much, was fain to go hungry home; and ſo their Meetings were more to fed themſelves, than to practice a piece of Chriſtian Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:48910:82"/>
                  <hi>to which thoſe Sacramental Aſſemblies were inſtituted. This certainly was to do as they were wont at home, and they might as well have ſtayed there, as have done thus; this was quite contrary to the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Church-Meetings, and not only to ſend away hungry, but even to Reproach and put to ſhame thoſe that were in want, and were not able to bring any great offering along with them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HENCE it appears, that the <hi>Regular</hi> way of Celebrating the Euchariſt in the Apoſtles days, was for all men, eſpecially for the Rich and Wealthy ſort, to bring liberal Oblations with them to the Church to relieve the Poor, and upon part of thoſe Oblations to feed together, with that Humility, Impartiality, and Communicativeneſs of affliction, which became a Family whereof the tender-hearted Jeſus is the <hi>Head.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. AND to confirm this thing further, it is obſervable, that theſe Feaſts which accompanied the Holy Sacrament were called <hi>Agapae,</hi> or <hi>Feaſts of Love;</hi> and St. <hi>Jude</hi> makes expreſs mention of them at the 12. verſe of his Epiſtle, where ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the lewd <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Theſe are Spots,</hi>

                  <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 46. for having told us of the firſt Apoſtles, that they <hi>continued daily in the Temple,</hi> that is, at the <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> Service, and Worſhip, uſed by the <hi>Jews:</hi> He mentions next their retiring <hi>afterwards</hi> to ſome of the upper Rooms <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout</hi> the Temple to celebrate Chriſtian Euchariſt; there they <hi>brake Bread, and did eat their Meat with gladneſs and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleneſs of Heart,</hi> with that Simplicity and Liberality which became them.</p>
               <p>AT firſt, the Celebration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment followed theſe Feaſts of Charity, and came at the cloſe of all; Herein Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans follow the Example of our Saviour, who inſtituted the Euchariſt at the <hi>end</hi> of his laſt Supper: But becauſe ſome were diſorderly at theſe Solemnities, and brought a <hi>Scandal</hi> upon Religion by their <hi>Exceſs</hi> and <hi>Intemperance,</hi> in proceſs of time this Cuſtom was alter'd; and Chriſtians were wont to receive the Sacrament <hi>Faſting,</hi> and then they proceeded to the <hi>Love-Feaſt</hi> upon ſome <hi>Remains</hi> of the Offerings. But the former Abuſes continuing ſtill, thoſe <hi>Feaſts</hi> too, were at laſt wholly laid aſide; becauſe what was intended for purpoſes of Charity, was perverted to Riot and Exceſs, by the extravagant and ungovernable Liberty which ſome ill Men took, to whom St. <hi>Peter</hi> points, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13.

                  <hi>That the Faithful having ended their uſual Prayers, and ſaluted each other with a kiſs, they offer'd to the Chief Miniſter Bread, Wine, and Water, which he receiving at their hands, offer'd to God with large Praiſes and Thankſgivings for their enjoyment of his Creatures; to all which the whole Congregation devoutly ſaid, Amen.</hi> This Thankſgiving being ended, diſtribution was made of thoſe things o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver which thoſe Solemn Thanks had been given; every Communicant had a ſhare, and ſome of the Oblations were by the Deacons carried to ſuch as were <hi>abſent.</hi> But, ſaith <hi>Juſtin Martyr, they that were Wealthy and Liberal, gave every Man</hi>

                  <hi>what he would according to his own Pleaſure: And the Collection was committed into the hands of the Chief Miniſter, who relieved out of it Orphans, and Widows, thoſe that were ſick, and thoſe that were in want upon any other account, Priſoners, Strangers, and in ſhort, all that were in neceſſity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE <hi>Primitive Chriſtians,</hi> though they knew themſelves to have been diſcharged from their Moſaical Ordinances, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently not bound to offer any <hi>Bloody</hi> Sacrifices, or other Oblations that were <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> of our Saviour; yet they look'd upon ſome Oblations as Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of a <hi>Moral</hi> Duty, as acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements of God's <hi>Soveraignty</hi> over all things, as Expreſſions of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> to him, and as neceſſary Acts of Charity to his poor Creatures. And thus we are told by St. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who was but one remove from the times of the Apoſtles: <note n="*" place="margin">Iren. <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 34.</note> 
                  <hi>The Oblation of the Church, which the Lord would have to be offered in the whole World, is reputed by God a pure Sacrifice, and accepted by him; not that he ſtands in need of any Sacrifice from us, but becauſe the advantage of it redounds to the Offerer, when his Gift is accepted; for a Gift to a King is an Expreſſion of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Affection; which our Lord, willing that we ſhould offer in Simplicity and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,</hi>

And 'tis not Oblations in General that is forbidden; no, there were Oblations among the Jews, and there are Oblations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us; there were Sacrifices at the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and there are Sacrifices in the Church; it is only the kind of Sacrifices and Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that is changed. Therefore it behoveth us to make an Oblation, that we may ſhew our Gratitude and Thankfulneſs to God the maker of all things, with a pure Mind, with Faith unfeigned, with a firm Hope, with fervent Love, offering unto him the firſt Fruits of thoſe Creatures which are his own.</hi> Therefore St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſeverely reprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">

               <p>SEVERAL more Teſtimonies might be produced were it needful; but thoſe are enough to ſhew that in the firſt and pureſt
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48910:84"/>
ages of Chriſtianity, the Celebration of the Euchariſt was conſtantly attended with Oblations, firſt to be offer'd unto God as an humble and grateful acknowledgement that he is the great Lord of all, and then to be applied as neceſſary and charitable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions for the uſes of the Church, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for the ſubſtance of the Poor.</p>
               <p>HENCE it is, that we read ſo often in the Ancients of <hi>Offering</hi> and <hi>Sacrificing,</hi> and the like; by which expreſſions they meant, not any new and real Sacrificing of Chriſt by the hands of the Prieſt, as ſome would make us believe; for the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians did not look upon the Euchariſt as ſuch a formal Sacrifice, but only as a <hi>Commemoration</hi> of that Sacrifice which Chriſt only for all offer'd upon the Croſs<hi>:</hi> but by Sacrificing they meant, partly the offering up of the joint Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole Congregation, their Prayers, and Praiſes, which are the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Sacrifices of the Heart, and partly alſo the Alms of the Congregation, which they firſt offered to the Prieſt, and he preſented and laid upon the Table; theſe were their Sacrifices; and ſo they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly called by St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 16. <hi>To do good, and to communicate forget not, for with ſuch Sacrifices God is well pleaſed.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:48910:85"/>
And hence alſo the Ancients familiarly called the Communion-Table the <hi>Altar;</hi> a word, which in all likelihood, they bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed of Chriſt out of that foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed place of Scripture, whence they took the thing, the Rite of Oblations. That the Primitive Profeſſors of our Religion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly uſed the <hi>Word,</hi> is abundantly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent out of the moſt ancient Writers, <hi>Ignatius, Tertullian,</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> the other <note place="margin">
                     <hi>See Mr.</hi> Mede<hi>'s diſcourſe upon this point.</hi>
                  </note> Apoſtolical Canons, and a great many Teſtimonies more. And though conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about words are trifles, yet to ſpeak freely, I ſee no juſt exception againſt the uſe of this word, as long as we uſe it in the genuine ſenſe of the Antient Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: For they called it an <hi>Altar,</hi> not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſuppoſition, as if the true Natural Body of Chriſt were really offer'd upon it, and that too, as a propitiation for the Sins of the Living and the Dead; no, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was any ſuch Corporal Preſence, or any ſuch Oblation either believed, or ſo much as dreamt of by the Church for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral hundred years after the beginning of Chriſtianity. But ſo they ſtiled it, perhaps becauſe the Death of Chriſt is <hi>Commemorated,</hi> and <hi>Annunciated</hi> Solemnly at the Table; but moſt plainly, becauſe the Congregation of Communicants did gather themſelves to it, <hi>to call upon God,</hi>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:48910:85"/>
and to preſent their <hi>Alms</hi> to be laid upon the Table, and this, not only for the more eaſie Celebration of the Euchariſt, but as a decent ſignification too, that whether they prayed, whether they gave Thanks, or whether they offered Alms, they did all to the Glory of Chriſt, and in the name of Chriſt, the Memorial of whoſe Death was celebrated <hi>there;</hi> and becauſe theſe Prayers, theſe Praiſes, theſe Alms were called <hi>Sacrifices</hi> and <hi>Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> therefore was the Table it ſelf, at which they were offered, called an Altar.</p>
               <p>TO conclude this point now. I think enough hath been ſaid concerning this Branch of Charity, at the Holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which conſiſteth in ſhewing Mercy and Liberality to the Indigent, eſpecially to thoſe who have the ſame Faith, and the ſame Hope with us. You ſee what ſpecial Reaſons there are to excite you to it at this great Solemnity, and how Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, Conſtant, and Uniform, the practice of all Chriſtians hath ſtill been as to this particular; which I was the more willing to ſhew, becauſe Examples commonly are very operative; and I am ſure, Ancienter, Nobler, Better grounded Examples, we cannot have of any Chriſtian Office that is required at our hands.</p>

               </head>
               <p>2. I Proceed now to the conſideration of the other Branch of Chriſtian Charity, which conſiſteth in <hi>Fraternal Forgiveneſs.</hi> In diſcourſing upon this, I am to ſhew. 1. What is meant by Frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Forgiveneſs. 2. How neceſſary it is when we come to the Lord's Table. 3. How this matter is to be made practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt then, Fraternal Forgiveneſs, as it is required and ſtated by the great Law of Chriſt, conſiſteth in two things. 1. In laying aſide all Deſires and Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>pure Revenge.</hi> This the Scripture calls, <hi>rendring of Evil for Evil;</hi> when an injur'd Perſon puniſheth the Offenders, not for any ends of <hi>Charity</hi> or <hi>Juſtice,</hi> but meerly for Puniſhment <hi>ſake,</hi> becauſe he delights in his Sufferings, and ſeeks only to ſatisfie a provoked and diſtemper'd Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. For the clearing up of this, becauſe it is a very material point, we muſt note, that when an Injury is committed, either againſt ones Perſon, or Intereſt, or good Name, one or other of theſe three things is
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48910:86"/>
apt to follow, between which we muſt carefully diſtinguiſh; either <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> or <hi>Reparation</hi> or <hi>Revenge.</hi> Diſcipline is, when the Offender is made to undergo Rebuke, or Shame, or Smart; and this, for his own <hi>Correction</hi> and future <hi>Amendment.</hi> Now the end of this, being nothing but <hi>Charity,</hi> or the doing of an Offender <hi>Good,</hi> it is not only very conſiſtent with, but very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto the Law of Chriſt: And ſo you Read it, St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 15, 16, 17. <hi>If thy Brother ſhall Treſpaſs againſt thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone; if he ſhall hear thee, thou haſt gained thy Brother: But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witneſſes, every word may be eſtabliſhed. And if he ſhall neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to hear them, tell it unto the Church: But if he neglect to hear the Church, let him be unto thee as an Heathen Man, and a Publican.</hi> Reparation is, when an Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is puniſht in his <hi>Fortunes,</hi> for the making up of that loſs or dammage, which by the Injury his Brother ſuſtains. Now the end of this being nothing but <hi>Juſtice,</hi> it is very conſiſtent alſo with the ſtanding Laws of Chriſtianity, that <hi>every Man muſt provide for his own, that we muſt live Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly in this World,</hi> and that <hi>he that doth wrong, ſhall receive for the wrong that he</hi>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:48910:87"/>
                  <hi>hath done,</hi> Col. 3. 25. But pure <hi>Revenge</hi> is, when a Man is puniſht, not out of any good intentions to <hi>himſelf,</hi> nor out of hopes of <hi>Repairing</hi> the injur'd Man's Loſſes, but only to retaliate one Act of Hoſtility with another, thereby to ſatisfie his <hi>Hatred and Anger.</hi> As for inſtance; a Man wilfully ſtrikes out <hi>thine</hi> Eye, and to recompence the blow, thou ſtrikeſt out his too; this is properly Revenge; here his Eye doth not make Amends or Reparation for the loſs of thine. Therefore the end of this being nothing but to hurt another, and to ſatiate a Brutiſh Appetite by inflicting Puniſhments, that are both Uncharitable and Impertinent, and that have nothing to be pretended for them, but an inhumane Pleaſure in doing Miſchief, it is utterly repugnant to his Religion, whoſe buſineſs in the World was <hi>to go about doing good,</hi> and to teach all his Followers to do the ſame. <hi>Ye have heard</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>that it hath been ſaid, an Eye for an Eye, and a Tooth for a Tooth: but I ſay unto you, that ye reſiſt not evil; but whoſoever ſhall ſmite thee on thy right Cheek, turn to him the other alſo,</hi> Mat. 5. 38, 39. That is, rather than return Injury for Injury, be contented to receive another. Though God by his right of abſolute Soveraignty over all, may puniſh obdurate Wretches
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:48910:87"/>
to ſhew his wrath and power, eſpecially when there are no hopes of amendment; yet we poor Creatures, who ſtand upon the ſame level, and are all of us a-kin on <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſide, ought ever to propoſe to our ſelves ſome Charitable ends in our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding with one another, not recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing any Man <hi>Evil for Evil;</hi> not <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging our ſelves,</hi> but <hi>rather giving place unto wrath;</hi> becauſe it is written, <hi>ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance is mine, I will repay, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Rom. 12. 17, 19. This is one part of Fraternal Forgiveneſs, to ſlight all that is paſt, without ſtrict Retalia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to void our minds of all mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious intentions, and not to think of any Puniſhments which are not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Rules of Charity, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Juſtice;</hi> of which Caſes I ſhall ſpeak by and by.</p>
               <p n="2">2. FRATERNAL <hi>Forgiveneſs</hi> muſt riſe higher yet; and that it may fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer its meaſures in the Goſpel, it muſt conſiſt in doing an Enemy <hi>Good</hi> too. This is the perfection, and the moſt perfect expreſſion of it; inſtead of Hurting after a revengeful manner, to Help, to Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, and to Intreat kindly every one, whoever he be that hath offended us. And this is that new ſort of Patience,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:48910:88"/>
which Chriſt hath taught his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, ſaith <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>Tertullian;</hi> to do good unto all Men without diſtinction or limitation. Even the Old Law required the <hi>Jews</hi> not to hate <hi>their Brethren in their hearts,</hi> Levit. 19. 17. Nay, it required them to do friendly Offices to one another, although there were enmity between them, as we find, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 4, 5. <hi>If thou meet thine Enemies Ox or his Aſs going aſtray, thou ſhalt ſurely bring it back to him again,</hi> &amp;c. But all this was meant with peculiar reſpect to their own Tribes and Countreymen; for <hi>other</hi> Nations they were permitted to hate, and in many Caſes were bound to treat them after an hoſtile manner. But Chriſt's Religion carries a far different Spirit with it. A Chriſtian is bound to look upon every Child of <hi>Adam</hi> as his Neighbour, though an Enemy even to the Faith, though without Chriſt, though an alien from the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and conſequently he is obliged not only to abhor all malicious Deſigns againſt him, but moreover to extend the utmoſt of his Charity unto him, like the common Maker and Father of us all, whoſe mercy is over all his Works. <hi>Ye have heard</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) Mat. 5. <hi>That it hath been ſaid, thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour, and</hi>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:48910:88"/>
                  <hi>hate thine Enemy; But I ſay unto you, love your Enemies, bleſs them that curſe you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that deſpightfully uſe you, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute you; that you may be the Children of your Father which is in Heaven; for he maketh his Sun to riſe on the Evil, and on the Good, and ſendeth rain on the Juſt, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt. For if ye love them only which love you, what reward have ye? Do not even the Publicans the ſame? And if ye Salute your Brethren only, what do you more than others? Do not even the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans ſo?</hi> Alas, this comes infinitely ſhort of the boundleſs and moſt generous Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſtianity, which teacheth us, not to be overcome by Evil, but to <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Evil with Good; if an Enemy hunger, to feed him, if he thirſt, to give him drink; and by ſo doing, to heap coals of fire upon his head;</hi> to melt and intender his Spirit, inſtead of calling for fire from Heaven to <hi>conſume</hi> him, as thoſe Diſciples would have done upon the heads of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> who knew not what Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Charity the Chriſtians Spirit is of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. THUS you ſee the nature of that Charity, which conſiſteth in Fraternal Forgiveneſs, in its full Latitude and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. To come cloſer to our purpoſe yet,

let us now in the next place conſider the particular neceſſity of this thing when we Celebrate this Divine Myſtery. <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our Treſpaſſes as we forgive them that Treſpaſs againſt us,</hi> is a Prayer we uſe daily by our Lord's own directions; and thereby we are taught, that Charity is always to be mixt with our Devotion, and that we ſhould pity the neceſſity of others Souls, as often as we call for mercy upon our own. But, as I have already ſhewn you, there are at this great So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity <hi>Special</hi> and <hi>Peculiar</hi> Reaſons to to actuate, not only our Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, but our <hi>Charity</hi> too, in its ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Parts and Properties; and therefore laying aſide at preſent the Conſideration of thoſe <hi>General</hi> Obligations which are derived from the Commands of Chriſt, that were given on other Occaſions; I ſhall take notice only of thoſe ſpecial Reaſons, which have a more peculiar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon our minds, from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of this <hi>Myſtery.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>IF thou bring thy Gift to the Altar, and there remembreſt that thy Brother hath ought againſt thee, leave there thy Gift be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Altar, and go thy way, firſt be reconciled to thy Brother, and then come and offer thy Gift,</hi> Matth. 5. 23, 24. It was this place of Scripture which gave
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:48910:89"/>
occaſion to the Primitive Chriſtians to call the Lord's Table an <hi>Altar,</hi> and juſt as they went about to offer up their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of Prayer, Praiſes, and Alms-deeds, to expreſs their Reconciliation and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Love, by Saluting each other with an Holy Kiſs, the Deacon having called out unto them, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, let <hi>none have ought againſt another.</hi> The pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Reaſons of this Charity, may be drawn from theſe 4 Conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. FROM the Conſideration of that Analogy, which this Chriſtian Feaſt bears to the Sacrifical Banquets of old, to which this Banquet doth in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure correſpond. <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Illud autem obſervatum ab antiquis videmus, ut quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Supplicationes aut lecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternia indicerentur, a jurgiis &amp; litibus abſtinerent, &amp; vinctis vincula demerent.</hi> Gyrald. Syntag. 17. page 482.</note> The <hi>Heathens</hi> themſelves were wont at thoſe Solemnities to give over all Strifes and Controverſies, and to releaſe ſuch miſerable Creatures as were in Priſons and Bonds. By the common light of Nature, they found it neceſſary for them all to appear before God with Calm and Unpaſſionate Minds, to teſtifie their freedom from ſowerneſs and rancour, by expreſſions of Humanity, and Forgiveneſs; ſo that their Religious Feaſts ſeem'd to reſemble that <hi>Chariſtia,</hi> which <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> ſpeaks of, a <hi>Feaſt of Love</hi> and entire Friendſhip.
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:48910:90"/>
I do not ſpeak this to leſſen the Dignity of this <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Euchariſt, but to ſhew, that if they made it a great part of their Religion to be thus diſpos'd, who wanted the aſſiſtance of Divine Revelation, and fed only upon Ritual and mean Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, which the Cuſtom of Nations had made every where common; certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Nobleſt acts of Charity muſt be required of us, who have been ſo often told of the infinite Love of God to us, and have the ſingular Honour and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to feed together upon that Lamb of God, which was Sacrificed for the forgiveneſs of the whole World.</p>
               <p n="2">2. HERE we Celebrate the Memorial of our Saviour's Sufferings; who refuſed not to be kiſt by the impureſt lips in the World, even when he knew that <hi>Judas</hi> his own Diſciple, his Almoner, came to betray him; who called him by no harder Name than <hi>Friend;</hi> who healed the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers Ear which had been cut off by the raſh zeal of another Diſciple; who held his peace, though oppreſs'd at his Tryal with falſe accuſations; who took no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the rudeneſs of their malice, when his implacable Enemies ſpit upon him, buffeted him, ſmote him on the face with their hands, that wanted nothing but to be embrewed in his Blood; who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:48910:90"/>
                  <hi>Peter,</hi> though he had Apoſtatiz'd, and flatly denyed him with Oaths and Imprecations; who pityed not himſelf, but thoſe poor People that followed him with tears to his Crucifixion, and uſed that ſoft expreſſion to them, <hi>Daughters of Jeruſalem weep not for me, but weep for your ſelves, and for your Children;</hi> who was led as a <hi>Lamb to the Slaughter,</hi> and as a <hi>Sheep that before his Shearers is dumb,</hi> who when he was <hi>reviled, reviled not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,</hi> and when <hi>he ſuffered, threatned not;</hi> but cloſed up his Life with a moſt <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable</hi> Prayer for his Enemies forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; in a word, who throughout this whole affair behaved himſelf with the moſt eminent Candour, Meekneſs, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Clemency that was poſſible, for him to expreſs; and all this, that he might leave us an <hi>Example that we ſhould follow his ſteps,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 21. Now when we ſee at this Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of that Great Sacrifice, the Bread broken, and the Wine poured out, the one repreſenting the bruiſing of his Fleſh, the other the pouring out of his Blood, both ſhewing how he was ſmitten of God, and afflicted; when we ſee this, and call to mind his Exemplary Patience and Charity throughout all his Sufferings; what can we gather hence, but theſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:48910:91"/>
thoughts, that <hi>we ſhould be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded;</hi> that Chriſt our Paſſover having been thus Sacrificed for us, we ſhould <hi>keep this Feaſt without the Old Leaven, and without the Leaven of Malice and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> that we ſhould put on as the Elect of God, Bowels of Mercy, Kindneſs, and Humbleneſs of Mind; that all Bitterneſs, and Wrath, and Anger, and Clamour, and Evil Speaking ſhould be put away from us, with all Malice; and that we ſhould be kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Chriſt's ſake hath forgiven us, and as Chriſt for his Mercy ſake forgave his very Murtherers.</p>
               <p n="3">3. AT this Great Solemnity, there is not only a Spiritual Union between <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and all good <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation alſo of that perfect Union which ought to be among Chriſtians <hi>themſelves.</hi> That one Loaf that is made up of many Grains all moulded together into one Lump; and that Cup that is made up of many drops all mixed together into one Maſs, ſhew that all who participate of theſe Symbols ſhould be joyned together into <hi>one</hi> Society, a Society animated with one and the ſame Spirit, a Society knit together by the Band of one Diſcipline, a Society of one Heart, and of one Mind, as well as of one Faith, and Hope. Many of the <hi>Ancients</hi> inſiſt much upon this, that
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:48910:91"/>
the Holy Sacrament is a Figure, both of that <hi>Natural</hi> Body of Chriſt which Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered upon the Croſs, and moreover of that <hi>Myſtical</hi> Body of Chriſt, of which he was made the Head after his Reſurrection: And one Reaſon of that Unity which ought to be among the ſeveral Members of this Body is, becauſe they are all fed and nouriſht at one Table; and ſo St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf tells us, that <hi>we being many are one Bread, and one Body, becauſe we are all partakers of that one Bread</hi> (or Loaf) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 17. This then is another pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Reaſon, why we ſhould appear at this Solemnity, a New, and unleavened lump, with Minds purged from all ferment of Malice and Wickedneſs, like Children of the ſame Father, and of one Family round about his Table, with Souls full of the moſt extenſive and unfeigned Charity, and with Spirits enflamed with the Love of God, and with Love to all that belong to God; the true Spiritual Incenſe which gives a ſweet ſmelling Savour to all our Offerings at the Altar. <hi>I beſeech you, Brethren,</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the beginning of that Epiſtle, wherein he taxed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the diſorders of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> at the holy Communion, I beſeech you, Brethren) <hi>by the Name of our Lord</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>that ye all ſpeak the ſame thing, and that there be no diviſions among you: but that ye be perfectly joined together in the ſame</hi>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:48910:92"/>
                  <hi>Mind, and in the ſame-Judgment,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 10.</p>
               <p n="4">4. TO this Solemnity we come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the pledges of <hi>our</hi> reconciliation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, the Ratification and Seal of our <hi>own</hi> Pardon and Forgiveneſs. <hi>This</hi> (ſaith our Saviour, ſpeaking of the Creature we are to drink, of the Fruit of the Vine, as 'tis expreſly called in the very next verſe, this) <hi>is my Blood,</hi> or the Communion of my Blood <hi>of the new Covenant, which is ſhed for many, for the remiſſion of Sins,</hi> Mat. 26. 28. But how can we expect to be pardoned our ſelves, if we do not let all Hatreds and Animoſities drop to the ground before we go unto the Altar? If we do not freely, heartily, and ſincerely pardon all others, as we our ſelves would be pardoned? <hi>If ye forgive Men their Treſpaſſes, your Heavenly Father will alſo forgive you: But if ye forgive not Men their Treſpaſſes, neither will your Heavenly Father forgive your Treſpaſſes;</hi> ſaith our bleſſed Lord, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 14, 15. Whence it is clear, that mutual Charity is one of thoſe many conditions which are neceſſary to make us capable and receptive of God's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. As when <hi>Chriſt</hi> gave the Keys of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to <hi>Peter,</hi> he intended all the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſhould have an equal ſhare of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; <note place="margin">Petro ſoli claves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, coeteris communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candas. Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat.</note> and to this purpoſe, he ſaid af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to all the Apoſtles, when he breathed on them, <hi>Whoſe ſoever Sins ye</hi>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:48910:92"/>
                  <hi>remit, they are remitted unto them; and whoſe ſoever Sins ye retain, they are retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> Joh. 20. 23. So, where pardon of Sin is promiſed to this or that <hi>Grace,</hi> there all other Graces are taken in, and ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, becauſe there is required a <hi>Complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of all Virtues in order to perfect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. Now of theſe Virtues, mutual <hi>Charity,</hi> or our forgiving each other, is <hi>one.</hi> Not that it procures our forgiveneſs by way of <hi>Merit</hi> (take heed of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, ſo vain in it ſelf, ſo deadly in its conſequences, ſo reproachful to the free Grace of God, and to the infinite Merits of our Redeemer) but that this mutual Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty doth <hi>diſpoſe, qualifie,</hi> and <hi>fit</hi> us for God's pardon. Therefore 'tis obſervable, that when our Lord gave his Church a Form of Prayer of his own compoſing, and in it taught us to pray; <hi>Forgive us our Treſpaſſes, as we forgive them that Treſpaſs againſt us.</hi> As ſoon as ever he had ended that Prayer, he preſently <hi>ſingled</hi> out this part of it to ſpeak to, inculcating and reaſoning upon this ſole point of fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal forgiveneſs, as being a point of ſuch great Moment and Weight, that without the practice of it, the reſt of the Prayer would be to little or no purpoſe. And to ſtrengthen the neceſſity of this thing far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet, he ſpake of it again afterwards, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. where we find a Parable of a
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:48910:93"/>
wicked Servant, to whom his Lord for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave a Debt of ten thouſand Talents; but becauſe upon his forgiveneſs, he dealt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifully with his Fellow-Servant, taking him by the Throat, and caſting him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Priſon for an hundred Pence, his Lord was very wroth with him, ſaying, <hi>O thou wicked Servant, ſhouldeſt not thou have had Compaſſion on thy Fellow Servant, even as I had pity upon thee?</hi> And ſo he deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to the Tormenters, till he ſhould pay all that was due unto him. The Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of all wich is very plain, but very <hi>terrible; ſo likewiſe ſhall my Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father do alſo unto you, if ye from your Hearts forgive not every one his Brother their Treſpaſſes,</hi> Mat. 18. 35.</p>
               <p n="3">3. TO draw now to a Concluſion, and to bring down this whole Matter cloſer yet to our Chriſtian Practice. Let Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and perfect Love be at once both the Rule and the Tenor of our whole Life in all Inſtances and Occurrences. Whatever Objections againſt our Religion are wont to be made by ſome (who yet of all Mankind are moſt to be blamed for their Uncharitableneſs) let us never give them occaſion to lay this blame upon our <hi>Manners</hi> (though it doth not ſo much as touch our Profeſſion it ſelf) that a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Strife and Hatred is among us. But
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:48910:93"/>
when we are about to Celebrate the bleſſed Euchariſt, then eſpecially we ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Angels Doxology, and prepare our Minds ſo that we may uſe it with enlarged and devout Hearts, <hi>Glory be to God on high, on Earth Peace, good will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Men.</hi> Then all undue Heats that by any Emergency may have been raiſed, ſhould vaniſh away from us like Smoak; then we ſhould put on, <hi>as the Elect of God, Holy and Beloved, Bowels of Mercy, Kindneſs, Humbleneſs of Mind, Meekneſs, Long-ſuffering, forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any Man have a quarrel againſt any; even as Chriſt forgave us, ſo ſhould we; and above all things put on Charity, which is the bond of Perfectneſs; and let the Peace of God rule in our Hearts, to the which alſo we are called in one Body;</hi> as the Apoſtle himſelf ſpeaks, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>TO provoke you hereunto, many argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments might be drawn, not only from the ſenſe of the beſt Heathens, who held it unlawful to revenge Injury with Injury, (upon which Subject <hi>Maximus Tyrius</hi> ſpends a whole Diſcourſe) but from the Noble <hi>Examples</hi> of many of them alſo, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aelian. Var. Hiſt. l.</hi> 12. <hi>c.</hi> 49.</note> and particularly that of <hi>Phocion,</hi> who after all the eminent Services for his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men, the <hi>Athenians,</hi> being at laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to be poiſoned, before the drank
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:48910:94"/>
off the deadly Potion, left this ſtrict charge with his Son, that he ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver remember ſo as to be revenged for the Injuſtice and Ingratitude of the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT becauſe Chriſtianity is a Religion of a moſt elevated Nature, and that which ſpeaks ſo plain, and ſo loud as to this point; and becauſe that noble part of it, this Chriſtian Solemnity, doth of it ſelf Miniſter arguments enough to command our Obedience as to this particular, I ſhall not go out of my way to pick up Obſervations, that may be more curious than neceſſary; but rather content my ſelf with what hath been ſaid already, and ſo ſhut up this Subject with a few Conſiderations which immediately relate to our Chriſtian Practice.</p>
               <p>I told you before, that all Acts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge are quite contrary to the Laws of Chriſt's Religion; meaning by Revenge all ſpiteful acts, or purpoſes of hurting another for hurt-ſake, without conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had of a good end, whether of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or Juſtice: and then I diſtinguſh pure Revenge from ſuch acts as concern Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline or Reparation; which two laſt caſes being ſo incident to human life, and caſes wherein the Conſciences of Men ought to be well inſtructed and govern'd, I ſhall now
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:48910:94"/>
at the cloſe of all ſpeak ſomething by way of direction as to theſe two caſes; and the rather, becauſe I have found by frequent experience, that upon Injuries which too commonly happen between Man and Man, divers have been hindred from the uſe of the bleſſed Sacrament, for want, as I am willing in Charity to ſuppoſe, of due Information.</p>
               <p n="1">1. FIRST then, as to acts of Diſcipline, It is not at all inconſiſtent with the great ends of this Sacred Ordinance, nor with our Duty in order to it, or at it, to uſe honeſt means of reprehending or correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Offender, provided thoſe means be uſed after a diſcreet and friendly manner, and for the Offender's good. So the Magiſtrate may puniſh a diſorderly Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, a Father his Child, a Maſter his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, in all neceſſary caſes. For this is not properly Revenge; becauſe the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, though they may be ſomewhat ſtrict, are ſtill for charitable ends, <hi>viz.</hi> For the amendment and Reformation of the Offender; which in ſuch caſes every Man ſhould carry in his Eye: for what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of his own Authority in the Church, is very applicable to all juſt Power whatſoever, the Lord hath given it <hi>for Edification, and not for Deſtruction,</hi> 2 Cor. 10. 8.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:48910:95"/>
2. AS to Caſes which concern Repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for Injuries, they admit of great variety, according to the variety of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Circumſtances; but I think what is generally neceſſary to be known, may be comprehended within theſe following Rules, or reduced to them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. WHERE an injury is <hi>Plain, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident,</hi> and <hi>Palpable,</hi> Men are to ſeek for redreſs firſt, by fair and private ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications. This is not Revenge, nor any breach of Duty, becauſe it is a Caſe of Juſtice purely, and the method is Friendly and Charitable. To this may be applied thoſe words of our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. <hi>If thy Brother Treſpaſs againſt thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone; but if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more,</hi> &amp;c. And if any thing be needful to be added, certainly a more prudential Courſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be taken, than what our Lord elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where preſcribes, <hi>Agree with thine Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary quickly, whilſt thou art in the way with him,</hi> Matth. 5. 25. Such Timely and Pacifick means of accommodation are apt to preſerve Charity; whereas other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods that are rough may, like a wound that feſters, make a deep impreſſion upon the Senſe, and corrupt Friendſhip, ſo as to turn it into Rage, or a ſetled hatred.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:48910:95"/>
2. IF ſuch Chriſtian applications can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not obtain their End, the Offender muſt be forborn; provided the injury be not conſiderable in it ſelf or in its Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, although it be evident. 'Tis true, a wrong being done, he that did it becomes liable to Juſtice; but it doth not follow, that a Man may not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear him in light and trivial matters; for Charity and Peace ſake we are to poſſeſs our Souls in Patience, with an humble ſubmiſſion to the good Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God for reparation in his way. And to this purpoſe is that Law of Chriſt, Matth. 5. 39, 40. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall ſmite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other alſo; and if any Man will ſue thee at the Law, and take away thy Coat, let him take thy Cloak alſo.</hi> Theſe are Proverbial Expreſſions, which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie light and inconſiderable Injuries; and they are to be underſtood in a <hi>Comparative</hi> ſenſe to this purpoſe; that when wrongs are ſmall, and of no great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er account than a little blow, or an upper Garment amounts to, rather than venture the breach of Peace or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, we are to be content with the loſs, if Reparation cannot be obtained by <hi>ſoft</hi> and gentle Proceedings.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:48910:96"/>
3. WHERE the injury is heavy and grievous, ſo that Reparation becomes <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,</hi> you are not to require it with your own hands, or by private and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal violences, but by the help of the Magiſtrate. <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid.</hi> Grot. <hi>de jure belli.</hi> lib. 2. c. 20. Sect. 8.</note> To this purpoſe is that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Law of Chriſtianity, Rom. 12. 9. <hi>Dearly Beloved, avenge not your ſelves,</hi> but rather give place unto wrath; for it is written, <hi>Vengeance is mine, I will repay it, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. AS appeals to the Magiſtrate in weighty Caſes are Lawful (for he is the Miniſter of God, and his Office is to Relieve ſuch as are Oppreſſed) ſo muſt the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings before him be without Covetouſneſs, without Envy, without Siniſter Arts, and without any Gall and Bitterneſs of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. For whatever a Man's Loſſes are, he muſt not loſe or let go his Charity. He ſhould Love and Pity, and be ready to ſhew Mercy, and to do good Offices to the Offender, even when he ſeeks Repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for the Offence it ſelf. An enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Heart, an Ulcerated Mind, Affections foaming out hatred and malice, theſe are the worſt of Plaintiffs in the beſt of Cauſes: They ſpoil in a great meaſure a very juſt Controverſie, and make it all one in effect with Cruelty and Revenge; with this ſcurvy difference, that a Mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:48910:96"/>
Suit many times cuts deeper wounds than a private ſtroak, when 'tis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced upon premeditation, and carried on with implacability, and is at laſt armed with the Sword of publick Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
               <p>NOW by theſe Four Rules a Man may examine his Condition, and make a right judgment of his Charity; as every one ought to do, before he comes to the Holy Communion. If he ſeeks for Repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration by fair means, and after a Friendly and Chriſtian manner; if it be not any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward rancour or hatred that moves him to it, but only the nature of the injury; if it be of ſuch importance as that it makes Redreſs neceſſary either for himſelf, or for his Relatives, who have a dependance upon him, and ſome ſhare with him in all his Civil Rights; if he be not his own avenger, but commits his Cauſe into the hands of thoſe who judge for the Lord; and if in his whole Behaviour he mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth himſelf with Chriſtian ſimplicity and candour of mind, and with an heart deſirous of perfect Reconciliation and Peace. I do not ſee what juſt reaſon ſuch a Man hath to forbear the uſe of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrament. The Injurer indeed is bound to make Reparation, and by all poſſible means to Sollicite his Friendſhip,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:48910:97"/>
and to beg his Forgiveneſs; but the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Party hath done all that either a Good or a Prudent Perſon can be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed able to do in ſuch Circumſtances. But if Malice, or Spight, or Inhumanity, a Quarrelſom Mind, a vexatious Spirit, an Oppreſſive or Revengeful Humour be at the bottom of all this, or in any part of it, I have no more to ſay, but that ſuch a one muſt bewail his great wickedneſs, and Repent of it, and implore the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of God and Man for it, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to new-mould and rectifie his Uncharitable and Unchriſtian Temper, before he preſume to go to the Lord's Table; the Bleſſed Sacrament being too Holy a Thing, to be put into the mouth of a Tyger, or a Wolf. And ſo much ſhall ſuffice to be ſpoken upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>

FIRST then we are to Conſider, that we are going upon no leſs a buſineſs than to offer up our <hi>Whole Man,</hi> not our Souls only (though that be the chief Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation) but our very <hi>Bodies alſo, a Living Sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is our reaſonable Service,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, Rom. 12. 1.</p>
               <p n="2">2. THAT we may not preſent the Sacrifice of Fools, nor turn our Offerings into an Abomination; 'tis neceſſary for us
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:48910:98"/>
to entertain very ſerious and awful thoughts of God's Omniſcience, that we are in his preſence, and under his eye, that he obſerves our whole deportment, that he ſearcheth our Hearts and Reins, and underſtandeth our Thoughts afar off. Accordingly we muſt preſent our ſelves before him, not as a thing of courſe, or only to comply with a Cuſtom, but as in the ſight of God, with reverent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of his Divine and Infinite Majeſty, with all Lowlineſs and Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Mind, with Souls bowing and caſt down to the duſt, under the ſenſe of our own unworthineſs, with Conſciences void of all Offence, with Spirits enflamed with the Love of God and Man, and with that true ſincerity and ſimplicity which is the inſeparable Ornament of every ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt heart, and which in the ſight of God is of great price.</p>
               <p n="3">3. THE happy hour being now come, that we are to be entertained at God's Table, and muſt take the Seals of his Covenant into our Mouths, we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the promiſes we made to God in private, we ſhould repeat our Vows and Reſolutions, and put our Souls upon freſh exerciſes of Faith and Holineſs.</p>
               <p>SEEING Holineſs ever becometh the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:48910:98"/>
Houſe of God, and eſpecially when we Celebrate this Holy Myſtery, we are to void and empty our Minds, as much as 'tis poſſible, of every thing that is earthly or unclean; to lift up our hearts, and fix them upon things above; to employ our thoughts only upon that Divine Service we are now concern'd in; to be full of Heavenly Contemplations, and ſo to warm our affections by them, that with Angels, or Archangels, and with all the Company of Heaven we may moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly Praiſe and Magniſie the Name of him, whom thoſe Bleſſed Spirits above continually worſhip, and reſt not day and Night, ſaying <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BE ſure to act your Repentance over again, becauſe this is the thing which through the blood of Chriſt doth ſanctifie the unclean, and render us capable of the Benefits of the Sacrament. Mortifie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Members which are upon the Earth, and all the ſinful deeds of the Body, Adultery, Fornication, Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Inordinate Affection, Evil Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence, Covetouſneſs (which is Idolatry) Hatred, Variance, Emulations, Wrath, Strife, Seditions, Hereſies, Envyings,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:48910:99"/>
Murthers, Drunkenneſs, Revellings, and ſuch like, of which the Holy Scripture plainly tells us, that they <hi>which do ſuch things ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> Gal. 5. 21. Theſe Vices therefore, and whatever elſe any of us may be more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially addicted or enclined to, we muſt ſeriouſly endeavour by the help of God's Grace, and to the utmoſt of our power to ſubdue and caſt away from us; and then is a moſt neceſſary time to do this, at leaſt to do it in purpoſe and reſolution of heart, when we are now going to the Holy Table; then it is time indeed to reſolve upon amendment and newneſs of Life, and to vow entire obedience to the Laws of Chriſt's Religion, as far as 'tis conſiſtent with this State of mortality and weakneſs, and as far as 'tis poſſible for poor Creatures that are compaſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with ſo many infirmities; then it is time to <hi>cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of Fleſh and Spirit,</hi> to <hi>enter</hi> at leaſt upon a Life of Holineſs; to waſh our hands and hearts in Innocence, <hi>and ſo to compaſs the Altar of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BEING thus rightly diſpoſed, we are then to behold the Fountain which is opened to us for Sin, and for Uncleanneſs, I mean the blood of Chriſt, <hi>which purgeth our Conſciences from all dead works, to ſerve</hi>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:48910:99"/>
                  <hi>the living God,</hi> Heb. 9. 14. Now 'tis a ſeaſonable time for us to call to mind the coronary Thorns, the Scourge, the Nails, and the Spear which <hi>opened</hi> this Fountain. To remember our bleſſed Lord's Agony in the Garden, his bloody Sweat, his Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetings and Stripes, his dolours and moſt bitter Death upon the Croſs. To conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that all this was for us ſinful Men, and for our Salvation, to reconcile us to his Father, <hi>to Redeem us from all Iniquity, and to beget us again to a lively Hope, to an Inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reſerved in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for us;</hi> becauſe he ſo loved us all, <hi>that whoſoever believeth in him ſhall not periſh, but have Everlaſting Life.</hi> Theſe Holy Meditations are not only proper and ſeaſonable, when we are now at the Supper of the Lamb, but they are more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over naturally apt to enflame your Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions with the love of Jeſus, to diſſolve and melt you into Penitential ſhowers, to raviſh your Hearts with a ſenſe of his infinite Goodneſs, to fill you with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Extaſies and Raptures, and to fix your Reſolutions of obeying for ever the Author of your Salvation; of following his bleſſed ſteps with all Meekneſs and Humility, and of bearing, not only his Yoak, but even his Croſs too, and in all
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:48910:100"/>
things of being made conformable to his Image.</p>
               <p>NEXT to the love of God, and of Chriſt, let the love of all Mankind reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh and poſſeſs your Hearts. God forbid that Malice, or Uncharitableneſs, or Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs, and Rancour of Spirit, God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid that any of theſe, or ſuch unclean things ſhould ever be brought before the Altar of Peace, and Reconciliation. If he ſo loved us, we ought to love one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; becauſe, <hi>he taſted Death for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man; he is not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> he is <hi>the Saviour of all Men, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of them that believe;</hi> and ſeeing every Soul is precious in his ſight; every Soul ſhould be dear to <hi>us;</hi> and our Love to all Mankind ſhould be extenſive and unlimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as <hi>his</hi> was: And to expreſs this Love we ſhould be ready to do good to all, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and endeavour the Salvation of all, and devoutly pray (as the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians did, whoſe Hearts were ſo warm with the Blood of Chriſt) <hi>for the whole Race of Mankind,</hi> not only for the Church of God, and for every part and Member there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but for all too that are as yet without the borders of the Sanctuary, and for all Eſtates and Conditions of Men, that no corner of the Univerſe may be too remote for our
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:48910:100"/>
Charity, and that however the Uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Chances, or the Evils of this World may ſever or <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> us, yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may be able to <hi>ſeparate</hi> us from the love of thoſe for whom Chriſt died.</p>
               <p>THESE are Divine things to exerciſe and employ your Minds at this great So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity. And as touching your outward deportment, there are theſe particulars, which I would recommend to your Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian practice at the time of Miniſtration.</p>
               <p n="1">1. THAT ye diſpoſe of your ſelves as <hi>near</hi> as may be to the Lord's Table, that you may behold what is tranſacted there. For beſides the <hi>Decency,</hi> which is in the thing it ſelf (when the Children of God humbly preſent themſelves round about his Table) this is apt to <hi>exalt</hi> and <hi>heighten</hi> your Devotion ſtill, and to give your Affections a new warmth, when you <hi>ſee,</hi> as it were, Jeſus Chriſt crucified <hi>before your Eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. THE Myſtery of his Paſſion being thus viſibly repreſented, by the breaking of the Bread (the Symbol of his Body) and by the pouring out of the Wine (the Symbol of his Blood) then <hi>ſurſum corda</hi> (as the Exhortation was in the Primitive Ages of Chriſtianity) <hi>lift up your Hearts</hi> to him who was dead, and is now alive for evermore, and offer unto him private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:48910:101"/>
theſe, or the like holy Ejaculations: <hi>O Lamb of God that takeſt away the Sins of the World, grant us thy Peace: O Lamb of God that takeſt away the Sins of the World, have Mercy upon us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. THROUGHOUT the Prayer of the Church wherein <hi>you</hi> are concern'd, be ſure to bear your <hi>Parts</hi> with <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Voice</hi> too. For this doth not only help to preſerve a Man's <hi>own</hi> Zeal in a due Fervour, and to keep his mind <hi>fixt</hi> and <hi>intent,</hi> and free from diſtraction, but it is moreover an excellent means to raiſe the Devotion of <hi>other</hi> Communicants. When every one aſſiſteth, and all jointly min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle their Devotions, the common flame is very much increaſed, every one bringing ſparks to the Altar, to kindle in each others Heart the love of Chriſt. For the confirmation of this, I appeal to every ſenſible Mans experience, who deſires to ſerve God <hi>in the Beauty of Holineſs.</hi> How lovely, how delightful a thing is it, when People meet <hi>together</hi> to Worſhip God, to ſend up their Prayers and Praiſes to him with <hi>one</hi> Lip? And how apt is this to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire every good Heart with Fervency, and to heat every ones Affections, each Man catching ſome fire from his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour? How like then is the Church to Heaven, and how tranſported do we ſeem
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:48910:101"/>
to be, as if we were among that bleſſed Quire above, where St. <hi>John</hi> in his Viſion ſaw the four and twenty Elders falling down before him that <hi>ſat on the Throne, and worſhipped him that liveth for ever and ever, and caſt their Crowns before the Throne, ſaying, Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive Glory, and Honour, and Power; for thou haſt created all things, and for thy Pleaſure they are and were created,</hi> Rev. 4. 10, 11. And where ſhould we imitate this bleſſed and Heaven-like Harmony, if not at this Divine Solemnity, where we celebrate the memorial of our <hi>Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> too? of our Redemption, I ſay; the <hi>great</hi> work of God, a work ſo worthy of God, <hi>ſo</hi> ſtupendious, ſo full of the Riches of his Grace, that to be <hi>unconcern'd</hi> among the common Thankſgivings of the Church, muſt needs be an Argument of a Mind ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dull and inſenſate, very deeply poſſeſt with a Spirit of Slumber.</p>
               <p n="4">4. WHEN you are now to receive the Divine Food, and Jeſus, as it were, <hi>coming under your Roof,</hi> receive with all <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;</hi> let every lofty imagination <hi>fall,</hi> and every Knee <hi>Bend:</hi> Not that we may adore the Sacramental Bread and Wine <hi>(that were Idolatry to be abhorred of all faithful Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians)</hi> but as an humble Profeſſion of our own great <hi>unworthineſs,</hi> and as a grateful
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:48910:102"/>
                  <hi>Acknowledgement</hi> of thoſe infinite <hi>Mercies</hi> werewith God is pleaſed to crown us at this time, it is no more than what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and becoming us to be proſtrate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="11" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>Of Kneeling when People Receive.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>ANY Reaſonable and Humble Man may think, that of thoſe few Ceremonies which are enjoyned in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> none can be leſs lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Objections, than the poſture of Kneeling at the Celebration of this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, where we poor ſinful Wretches are to receive ſo many ſtupendious Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies at the hand of God. And yet conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Scruples which have been cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in ſome Peoples minds about this Ceremony, and that many have run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from this great Chriſtian Ordinance, upon pretence that Kneeling is <hi>unlawful;</hi> I have thought it needful to inſert here a ſhort diſcourſe, to undeceive well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Perſons as to this particular.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:48910:102"/>
FOR your ſatisfaction in this caſe, I muſt lay down this principle, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is unlawful, muſt be <hi>contrary</hi> to ſome Law or other, either Moral or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive, either Natural or Revealed. For a Man cannot be ſaid to do an unlawful action, if that which he doth be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſome Rule: becauſe <hi>Sin is the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Law,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 4. So that where <hi>no Law is, there is no Tranſgreſſion,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 4. 15. And again, <hi>Sin is not imputed where there is no Law,</hi> Rom. 5. 13. If then the poſture of Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when we receive the holy Sacrament, be unlawful, we muſt ſuppoſe it to be a Violation of ſome Law; and then theſe three things muſt be ſuppoſed alſo.</p>
               <p n="1">1. THAT the Law againſt Kneeling (if there be any ſuch) is <hi>plain.</hi> For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Law being the Rule of Action, of Neceſſity it is required that it muſt be <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident;</hi> becauſe, otherwiſe we cannot know when we go right, or when we go wrong; which would be ſo far from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning us, that it would hinder us from acting at all; becauſe in all dark and doubtful caſes infinite Scruples muſt ariſe, which would render our Duty impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable. As for inſtance; if it be ſaid that there is a Divine Law about receiving the Holy Sacrament in ſuch or ſuch a
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:48910:103"/>
poſture, unleſs I can clearly <hi>diſcover</hi> and <hi>ſee</hi> the Law, it will be impoſſible for me to tell what poſture I am to uſe; and conſequently I muſt be diſcouraged from receiving at all; becauſe if I ſhould, I muſt act wholly upon uncertainties, my Conſcience being utterly unreſolved, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I uſe the right or wrong poſture. A Law muſt be diſcernable and eaſie to be found out, eſpecially in this caſe, wherein all Chriſtians whatſoever, both Learned and Unlearned, are equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd.</p>
               <p n="2">2. IT muſt be ſuppoſed, that this Law lieth in ſome poſitive Precept or other, or elſe is fetcht from ſome leading and Authoritative Example. For conſidering that every poſture is indifferent in it ſelf, neither abſolutely neceſſary, nor abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſinful, it is impoſſible to conceive how I ſhould be determined and bound up to the uſe of one, rather than another, but by ſome Command that peremptorily requires my Obedience, or by ſome over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling Example that exacteth my imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. One of theſe things muſt be the Law in caſes of this nature; or elſe there can be none.</p>
               <p n="3">3. IT muſt be ſuppoſed too, that this Law (whether it be grounded upon ſome poſitive Precept, or upon Authoritative
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:48910:103"/>
Example) is clearly and evidently to be found in the <hi>Word of God.</hi> For, to make that unlawful, which the Word of God hath no where forbidden, is to ſay in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that the Word of God is not the Rule we are to go by, that the Scriptures are ſcanty and imperfect, as to the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions of Good and Evil; that there is another Standard of our Duty over and above that Law of Liberty which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in the Bible, and that the great Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver of the World did not make ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Proviſions for the Information and Government of Mens Conſciences; and then the next thing is, that Men will ſet up any pretence againſt the Law of Chriſt, and call Evil, Good; and Good, Evil; according as their Fancy is, and juſt as the Humour takes them.</p>
               <p>THESE three things being premiſed, we now deſire our Diſſenting Brethren to ſhew us where any Law againſt Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Sacrament is plainly delivered in the whole Word of God. If they ſay the thing is unlawful, when there is no Law againſt it, all their talk is nothing but an heap of Non-ſence. If they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſuch a Law, but cannot tell where to find it clearly, they ought to conſider that doubtful Suppoſitions and uncertain Conjectures are no Rules of Conſcience,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:48910:104"/>
nor ſufficient grounds for ſeparation from a Church that cannot be proved a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor. If they will ingeniouſly confeſs (as they ought) that there is nothing in the Scripture that condemns a kneeling poſture, we ſhall take it as a ſufficient Vindication of our Innocence, and thank them for being ſo juſt to us; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, muſt leave it to their ſerious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, whether they have not forſaken the Proteſtant Principle, of the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Holy Scriptures, in making that to be Sinful, when in the account of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it is not ſo?</p>
               <p>BUT to bring the Controverſie to a full Iſſue in this caſe, we of the Church of <hi>England</hi> do go upon three ſure Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. 1. That Chriſt gave no poſitive Command (that we read of) about any one particular kind of poſture. 2. That nothing can be clearly againſt our kneeling poſture, from the Example of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, or of his Apoſtles. 3. That were we ſure what their poſture was at the Inſtitution of this Myſtery, it ought not to be judged a leading and Authoritative Example nevertheleſs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. FIRST, we ſay, that Chriſt gave no poſitive Command (that we read of) about any one particular kind of poſture. Of the truth hereof, any Man may be
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:48910:104"/>
ſatisfied preſently, by looking into the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that is given in the Scriptures of the Inſtitution of this Sacrament. For neither do the Evangeliſts, nor St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak one word of any particular poſture that was ordered at the Celebration of this Myſtery. Indeed, our Saviour ſaid, <hi>Do this</hi> (meaning what he and his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples did then) as St. <hi>Luke</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> affirm. But that Command relates only to the <hi>Action</hi> of Miniſtring and Receiving of Chriſt's Paſſion; it doth not in any wiſe reſpect a <hi>Poſture.</hi> For St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Mark</hi> render it, <hi>Take, eat, and drink ye all of this</hi> (as St. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſpeaks of the adminiſtration of the Cup:) So that by <hi>doing this,</hi> muſt be meant only the Sacramental <hi>Action.</hi> Beſides, it is not ſaid ſimply, <hi>Do this,</hi> but <hi>Do this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me,</hi> which manifeſtly relates to the <hi>breaking</hi> of the <hi>Bread,</hi> and to the <hi>pouring</hi> out of the <hi>Wine,</hi> whereby the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is repreſented; and it is not the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture</hi> (be it what it will) but the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration</hi> that is the Memorial of a broken and Crucified Jeſus. Laſtly, the Poſture is a <hi>Circumſtance</hi> only; and if Men ſuppoſe that the Command, <hi>Do this,</hi> reſpecteth <hi>that</hi> Circumſtance, they may as well ſuppoſe that it reſpecteth all the other Circumſtances too; and then they muſt
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:48910:105"/>
think themſelves bound to Celebrate the Lord's Supper at <hi>Night</hi> too, and after a Meal, and in a private Houſe, and in an upper Room, and with ſuch a Select Number, and with Unleavened Bread, and the like. For the Command extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to <hi>all,</hi> as well as to <hi>one</hi> Circumſtance, if Men argue that way; but the truth is, it extendeth to no Circumſtance at all, and conſequently not to any one ſort of Poſture; and therefore it muſt be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that neither Kneeling, nor any other Poſture is in it ſelf Unlawful, or Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory to any poſitive Command of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. IT muſt be then ſome <hi>Example</hi> or other of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, that is pretended to be againſt us; and this I know is the general Objection, which I ſhall conſider diſtinctly, becauſe at the firſt ſight there ſeem to be ſome intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Scripture, which are apt to ſtartle ſuch people as do not read the Sacred Story with due Conſideration and Care.</p>
               <p n="1">1. THEY ſay that Kneeling was not our Saviour's poſture, when he himſelf did eat of this Bread, and drink of this Cup. But now, what if our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour did not receive this Sacrament <hi>at all?</hi> Indeed 'tis commonly thought, and confidently affirmed that he did ſo; but
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:48910:105"/>
if we look well into it, we may find it a very improbable preſumption; and I am clearly of Opinion, that it is a vulgar Errour, and my Reaſons are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. WE cannot gather ſo much from any part of Scripture. Indeed we read, that Chriſt did eat of the <hi>Paſſover</hi> with his Diſciples, and that when he had <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped</hi> upon the Paſſover, he inſtituted <hi>this</hi> Solemnity; but we find not the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation that he <hi>Communicated</hi> of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Elements, at or after the Inſtitution. St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> St. <hi>Mark,</hi> St. <hi>Luke,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> do all agree, that <hi>he took Bread</hi> (into his hands) that <hi>he bleſſed it,</hi> that he <hi>brake it,</hi> and then <hi>gave it to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples,</hi> commanding <hi>them</hi> to take and eat; moreover that he took the <hi>Cup</hi> (into his hands likewiſe) that he <hi>gave thanks</hi> over it, and that then he gave it to his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> that <hi>they</hi> ſhould drink of it. But in all the relation of the Story, there is not one word of his <hi>own</hi> eating of the Bread, or drinking of the Wine. Nor, <hi>2dly,</hi> is it probable, that he would do ſo, becauſe there was no reaſon for his <hi>own</hi> doing of it. He was bound indeed to Communicate of the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> becauſe he was a <hi>Jew,</hi> made under the Law, and conſequently obliged to obſerve the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical</hi> Ordinances; but this was a Myſtery
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:48910:106"/>
of his own appointing, and the Ends and Effects of it did concern his <hi>Church</hi> only; that his <hi>Church</hi> might Celebrate a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Memorial of him, that his <hi>Church</hi> might ſeal her Duty to God, and might have the pledge of God's Mercy and Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kindneſs to <hi>Her;</hi> that his <hi>Church</hi> might partake of <hi>Him,</hi> and of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> and receive all the bleſſings of the New Covenant. Theſe were weighty Reaſons in reſpect of Chriſt's <hi>Church;</hi> but they did not at all concern Chriſt <hi>himſelf.</hi> It was not reaſonable that he ſhould do this in memory of <hi>himſelf;</hi> it was not needful that this ſhould be a Covenant-Rite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him, and his Father; it is not conceiveable that he ſhould Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate of his own Body and blood; it was not poſſible, that he who was without Sin, ſhould Eat and Drink for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion <hi>of Sins;</hi> and therefore it is not probable at all, that he did Communicate of the Sacramental Bread and Wine with his Diſciples. And hence it neceſſarily followeth, that 'tis moſt irrational and abſurd to argue for or againſt any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, from our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s bodily deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the Inſtitution of this Sacrament, becauſe <hi>he</hi> himſelf was no <hi>Communicant</hi> at that time. For as touching the Poſture that was uſed at the <hi>Paſchal Supper</hi> (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:48910:106"/>
that poſture was) it is a thing of <hi>Foreign</hi> Conſideration, and impertinent to the <hi>Queſtion,</hi> and concerns not <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Cuſtoms of the <hi>Jews</hi> at their Paſſover (being grounded upon Peculiar and Special Reaſons) lay not the leaſt tie upon Chriſtians at this Sacrament. The Enquiry among <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s</hi> is, touching Chriſt's <hi>Example</hi> at this new Solemnity; and 'tis Ridiculous to conclude, that to kneel in the act of Receiving, is againſt the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of our Lord, when it appears more than probable that he himſelf received not; what he did at that time with his Diſciples, he did purely as their <hi>Maſter,</hi> and <hi>Prieſt,</hi> but not as a <hi>Gueſt</hi> with them <hi>then;</hi> ſo that if any Directions be to be taken from the Example of Chriſt, they ſerve to guide thoſe who in Chriſt's ſtead <hi>Miniſter</hi> at the Holy Table, rather than to Govern any that are <hi>Partakers</hi> of the Altar.</p>
               <p n="2">2. SEEING then there is no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt Kneeling from our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Example, let us proceed to the ſecond branch of the Objection, and ſee whether this poſture be againſt the Example of our Saviour's <hi>Diſciples?</hi> And for the void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>this</hi> pretence alſo, I think we may lay down this as a very ſafe Propoſition, that 'tis utterly <hi>uncertain</hi> in what poſture
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:48910:107"/>
the Diſciples received the Sacrament at the Lord's hand. For the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and full proof of this Matter, we muſt remember that there was a <hi>Twofold</hi> Feaſt which was Celebrated at that time, the Jewiſh Paſſover <hi>firſt,</hi> and <hi>after</hi> that was ended, this <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet. Now as to the poſture both of our Saviour, and his Diſciples at the <hi>Paſchal Supper,</hi> there is not much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; for it was for the moſt part a Recumbent or Leaning Poſture upon lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Beds.</hi> According to the ancient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of Feaſting, every Gueſt had his Pallet, and thereon he reſted himſelf, with his body leaning upon his left ſide, that his right hand might be at liberty for Food. <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p n="2">2. Now by this that hath been ſpoken it doth appear, that our Diſſenting Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren get nothing at all on their ſide for either of thoſe Geſtures which they uſe at the Sacrament, though we ſhould grant the Example of Chriſt and his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples at the Paſſover to be <hi>imitable.</hi> But for the further ſatisfaction of ſuch delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded people, let us go on ſtill. And the firſt point being already cleared, touching the Example of our Lord and his Retinue and the <hi>Paſchal</hi> Solemnity, I proceed, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to ſhew how difficult it is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine what poſture the Diſciples uſed at the <hi>Sacrament</hi> that ſucceeded the Paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, and how very <hi>uncertain</hi> that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is, which our Diſſenting Brethren go upon, whether it be a <hi>ſitting</hi> or a <hi>ſtanding</hi> Geſture which they are for, and how vainly and weakly they argue from the practice of the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE <hi>Paſchal Supper</hi> being ended, and our Saviour being now at perfect <hi>Liberty,</hi> how to employ the reſt of his time, he <hi>riſeth</hi> from his Pallet, and <hi>waſheth his Diſciples Feet,</hi> as we find, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. (for this waſhing was, as I conceive, at that time, whatever reaſons have been offered
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:48910:109"/>
by ſome learned Men to the contrary.) And after the moſt humble Miniſtration in all probability it was, that the <hi>Bleſſed Sacrament</hi> was inſtituted; but what the exact minute was, is uncertain; and what the Diſciples poſture was at the receiving of it, is uncertain alſo. That it was a <hi>ſitting</hi> poſture with their Bodies <hi>erect,</hi> there is not the leaſt Colour to imagine. For though variety of geſtures was uſed <note place="margin">
                     <hi>See the caſe of kneeling. part</hi> 1.</note> at the Paſchal Solemnity, yet I do not find that a <hi>ſitting</hi> geſture was uſed then at all; rather, it was look'd upon then as an Irregular, Indecent, and Scandalous poſture. That the Diſciples communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in the uſual <hi>Table poſture,</hi> as they lay along upon Beds, is an Opinion that is ſomewhat favoured by a Paſſage in <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. where we read, that having waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Diſciples Feet, Chriſt laid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf down the ſecond time; and after that, we read of St. <hi>John</hi>'s leaning by his Boſom; ſo that ſince this was St. <hi>John</hi>'s poſture, 'tis reaſonable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that 'twas the poſture of the <hi>reſt</hi> too; and then it may ſeem probable that they all received the Sacrament as they lay in that <hi>manner.</hi> But then on the other hand, all this is but bare <hi>Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;</hi> for it is uncertain what part of time it was, that the Diſciples were <hi>leaning</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:48910:109"/>
in that poſture, whether it was <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> or <hi>at,</hi> or <hi>after</hi> the Adminiſtration of the <hi>New</hi> Sacrament. For after the <hi>Paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over-Supper,</hi> our Lord ſpent much time in the upper Room with his Diſciples; ſome, in inſtituting this Myſtery; ſome, in giving hints to <hi>Judas,</hi> and in diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Treachery of his Heart by degrees: Some, in diſcourſing upon the neceſſary Virtue of Humility; ſome in comforting the Spirits of his ſorrowful Retinue; ſome in teaching them Love and Charity; ſome in Prayer; and ſome in ſinging an Hymn before they departed. Now we cannot certainly tell what particular point of time it was, yet St. <hi>John</hi> and his Fellow-Diſciples lay upon their Pallets the <hi>ſecond</hi> time; and therefore it is not evident, whether they communicated of the Symbols of their Maſter's Paſſion, in that <hi>Recumbent</hi> poſture or no. Some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain are of Opinion, that the Diſciples received the Sacrament in a <hi>ſtanding</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture; becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> were wont to ſtand when they <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> and <hi>gave Thanks</hi> to God; and they were acts of <hi>Worſhip</hi> which the Lord Jeſus performed at the Inſtitution of this Ordinance; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he might perform them perhaps after the accuſtomed <hi>manner:</hi> but ſtill this is only <hi>Opinion</hi> and <hi>Probability;</hi> it is not
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:48910:110"/>
                  <hi>certain,</hi> becauſe the Scripture gives us no account of it; 'tis altogether ſilent as to this matter; and therefore we dare not (we muſt not) define poſitively, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to the truth of it. Upon the ſame (and poſſibly <hi>better)</hi> reaſons, what if ſome ſhould affirm, that the Diſciples re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in a <hi>kneeling</hi> poſture? I know the notion will ſeem to be <hi>new;</hi> but yet it ſeems to be built upon as <hi>fair</hi> an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, as any of the former; at leaſt that they communicated in an <hi>Adoring</hi> and <hi>Worſhipping</hi> manner. This I am ſure of, that there are as ſubſtantial and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain grounds for this opinion, as for any of the <hi>reſt:</hi> This <hi>plainly appears,</hi> that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Perſons being ſurpriſed with a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den apprehenſion of our Saviour's digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of the greatneſs of his Power, did (after the accuſtomed manner in that Country) <hi>fall down before his Feet,</hi> ſo that St. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf did it, upon the miraculous Draught of Fiſh, <hi>Luke</hi> 5. And why might not all the Diſciples do this, at his inſtitution of the <hi>Bleſſed Sacrament</hi> (which he told them was the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own Fleſh and Blood) eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally after he himſelf had Preached unto them a Lecture of <hi>Humility,</hi> when he had waſhed their Feet? Indeed, the Sacred Story gives us no Authority to affirm this
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:48910:110"/>
                  <hi>poſitively</hi> and <hi>dogmatically;</hi> but yet there are <hi>probable</hi> Arguments for Mens Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture this way: And as far as I can ſee, all <hi>other</hi> Opinions are but <hi>Conjectures;</hi> and I hope we may have leave to opine as well as other Men.</p>
               <p>BUT we cannot be ſo confident, as to determine this matter, in regard that we want the Teſtimony of Scripture, though Reaſon may be on our ſide. And herein we would give a Pattern to our Diſſenting Brethren, to be modeſt in <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,</hi> for which they have no ſolid Foundation; where, I pray, is the ground they go upon, touching the unlawfulneſs of Kneeling, as a thing repugnant to the Example of the Apoſtles; ſince it cannot be proved, what that Example was? It might be a poſture of <hi>Kneeling</hi> and <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> for ought they know. Sitting it was <hi>not</hi> (I dare confidently affirm:) In all probability, 'twas not a ſtanding poſture neither; <hi>perhaps</hi> it was the poſture which we cuſtomarily uſe; if not, it was a <hi>lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> poſture upon Pallets: And no body now inſiſteth upon that for an Example to us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. AND yet, Thirdly, were the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples both of Chriſt's Diſciples, and of Chriſt himſelf, <hi>apparently</hi> ſuch, as ſome Men conjecture, they would not yet be
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:48910:111"/>
                  <hi>leading and Authoritative</hi> Precedents to us in this point. For 'tis generally agreed by all Chriſtian Divines, that the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Chriſt is not <hi>univerſally</hi> to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed (much leſs the Example of his <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples)</hi> In ſome things 'tis not poſſible, in other things 'tis not proper, in many things 'tis not neceſſary for us to follow that Copy. Where we have the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and the Precept <hi>too,</hi> there indeed we are bound (and I wiſh Men would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of thoſe <hi>weighty</hi> things, rather than of Matters of <hi>ſlender</hi> importance.) But where we have no <hi>Command,</hi> there to take an <hi>Example</hi> for our Rule, is to make our ſelves guilty in ſome inſtances of Folly, and in ſome of Superſtition, and Preſumption. The Practice of our Lord and his Diſciples is no Rule for us in <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantials</hi> and <hi>Rites,</hi> unleſs they are made neceſſarily Practical by ſome Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive <hi>Direction</hi> and <hi>Command.</hi> Now we have no Command in this Caſe, the one way, or the other (no, not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>Example)</hi> to direct us, and therefore they talk vainly and impertinently, who Condemn Kneeling at the Sacrament as an unlawful Poſture; ſince no Law can be derived either from Chriſt's <hi>Precept,</hi> or from <hi>His</hi> or his <hi>Diſciples</hi> Practice, that doth <hi>evidently</hi> riſe up in Judgment <hi>againſt</hi> it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:48910:111"/>
THE Church then being left to her Liberty what poſture to uſe, thought fit to chuſe that of <hi>Kneeling,</hi> for theſe three Reaſons chiefly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. TO teſtifie our belief of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's <hi>Godhead.</hi> Had he been a meer Creature, as all other Men are, we might have had ſome encouragement to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent our ſelves at his Table, as his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and in a common Table-Geſture, as thoſe are wont to do, who deny the Doctrine of his Divinity. But being the Eternal Son of God, and equal to the Father, he hath a Right and Claim to the humbleſt Services we can think of, to expreſs in ſome meaſure the ſenſe we ſhould have of his Infinite Greatneſs and Majeſty; eſpecially at an Ordinance which was inſtituted in Honour to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. AS a Poſture that is moſt ſuitable to the Nature of the Myſtery it ſelf. Here we Commemorate the Lord's Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Goodneſs and Love, his unexpreſſible Sufferings for us, and his humbling of himſelf to Death, even the Death of the Croſs. Here we feed upon the Symbols of his Body and Blood for the Pardon of all our Sins. Here we Seal anew unto God our Covenant of Faith, Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Obedience; and God reneweth unto us his Covenant of Grace and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:48910:112"/>
Here all that we do is Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; the Myſtery is a moſt Solemn En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, or Thanksgiving; a real and lively Form of praiſing God, as Pſalms and Hymns are at other times: And all this is attended with devout Prayer from the beginning to the end; the whole Congregation praying for all Eſtates and Conditions of Men; the Miniſter praying for every particular Communicant; and each particular Communicant conſenting to the Prayer, joyning his own ſuffrage, and praying in his own perſon for the preſervation of his Soul and Body. So that Adoration and Worſhip being our whole work at this time, it ought to be performed in an adoring poſture; not only with Eyes and Hands lifted up, but with bended Knees too, which all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have ever thought the moſt ſolemn and ſuitable poſture of Adoration.</p>
               <p n="3">3. THE Church hath choſen, it as a Poſture that is moſt expreſſive of our <hi>Gratitude</hi> to God for the aſtoniſhing Mercies which all Worthy Communicants receive at this Great Solemnity; For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of Sin, Peace with God, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the Holy Spirit, Divine Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from above, from the Man Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; with an Earneſt and Pledge of a Happy Reſurrection, and a Glorious Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:48910:112"/>
FROM all which Conſiderations every Pious and Humble Soul may argue after this manner. Since this is the Symbol of the blood of God, which was ſhed for me, and for many, for the Remiſſion of all our Sins, ſhall I not receive it upon my Knees? Since Heaven is his Throne, and the Earth his Footſtool, what place can be too vile, or what geſture too lowly, for Sinful duſt and aſhes? Since we are now admitted to the preſence of the Lamb, and to the Gate of Heaven; <hi>O come let us Worſhip, and fall down, and kneel before the Lord our Maker,</hi> and Redeemer. If the Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus</hi> in his Agony fell down with his Knees placed on the bare ground, how can I now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grudge the bowing of mine? Since the Praiſes of God are now to be in my mouth, what better Example can I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, than thoſe Elders in Heaven, who <hi>fell down before Him that ſat on the Throne, and Worſhipt Him that liveth for ever, and ever, ſaying—Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come?</hi> Since my Bleſſed Redeemer was pleaſed to humble himſelf even to the Death of the Croſs, what humility can be great enough for Me, who am now to gather up my Life and Happineſs at his feet? Since I am now to beg for a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:48910:113"/>
Eternity, and to offer up my whole ſelf a Reaſonable, Holy, and Living Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; what more reaſonable for me, than to beg God's acceptance of my Prayers and Oblation upon my bended Knees? And ſince my Eating and Drinking at the Lord's Table is a Pledge of ſo many ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious Mercies to come, how can I chuſe but kneel, when I take the Seals of his Promiſes at his hands?</p>
               <p>THIS is enough to ſhew what a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming and ſuitable poſture <hi>Kneeling</hi> is at this Great Solemnity, and how Natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it follows, where People entertain right Notions of it, and come unto it with humble Minds. Nor can I ſufficiently admire, that of all the Uſages in the Chriſtian Church, this ſo Significant, ſo Decent a Ceremony, ſhould ever become a ſtumbling-block, and matter of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. Certainly it muſt be an ill ſign of very Lofty Imaginations, when there is ſuch ſtiffneſs in Mens Knees.</p>
               <p>BUT it is high time for me to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>

               <p>WHEN we have thus devoutly employ'd this bleſſed hour, we muſt not imagine that our great Buſineſs is at an end; that we may now drop thoſe Religious Conſiderations which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto took up our time and thoughts; that we may now go home, leaving our Vows and Reſolutions behind us in the Church, much leſs may we think our ſelves free to fall afreſh upon our former courſe of Life. I muſt tell you, the greateſt part of our buſineſs is yet before us, and to ſtop and reſt here in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of thoſe things which have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto employ'd our minds, is the ready way to unravel our whole work, and to defeat the deſign of this Heavenly Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. For this Rite of <hi>Eating</hi> and <hi>Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> at the Lord's Table, though it be of admirable uſe, yet it is not <hi>naturally</hi> and <hi>intrinſecally</hi> good, as thoſe Acts and Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of the <hi>Mind,</hi> are, wherein the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and Excellence of Religion doth

conſiſt; but it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> a <hi>Relative</hi> thing, inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by our Saviour as a Means to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and carry on that Noble End, for which the <hi>Grace of God hath appeared unto all Men; that denying all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs and Worldly Luſts, we ſhould live Soberly, Righteouſly, and Godly in this preſent World,</hi> Tit. 2. 12. Here indeed we lay the Foundation of a life of Virtue, by devoting unto God the Powers and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of our Souls, and the Members of our Bodies: but as the Ground-work is in order to a Superſtructure; ſo are our Actions now in order to the further edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and perfecting of us, that we may be <hi>built up more and more in our moſt Holy Faith, and being ſitly framed together and compacted, may grow and riſe up by degrees to an Holy Temple for the Lord, to be an Habitation of God through the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS you will eaſily perceive, if you obſerve, 1. The Nature of the Ordinance it ſelf. It is firſt, a Repreſentation of the very Death of Chriſt; a Repreſentation exhibited to our Sences, by the breaking of the Bread, and the effuſion of the Wine. And what doth <hi>this</hi> mean, but to awaken our <hi>Fears,</hi> by ſhewing us the Terror of the Lord, who for the expiation of the World's Guilt, ſpared not his own Son, nor would be reconciled to the World at a
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:48910:114"/>
lower rate, than by delivering him up to Torments and Death for us all? What doth it mean, but to ſet our Zeal a work upon mortifying all our Luſts and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and upon perfecting Holineſs in the fear of God, becauſe Chriſt gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all Iniquity, and Purifie unto himſelf a peculiar People, zealous of good works? What doth it mean, but to make us ever watchful and circumſpect, leſt we tread under foot the Blood of the Son of God? Becauſe, if we ſin wilfully after we have received the Knowledge of the Truth, <hi>there remaineth no more Sacrifice for Sin, Heb.</hi> 10. 26. It is, ſecondly, a Memorial of Chriſt's Love, Love ſtronger than Death, that made him give his life a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom for the ungodly. And what doth <hi>this</hi> mean, but to kindle in our Hearts the moſt ardent Affections to Him again, who ſo loved us, as to die for us? The greateſt Affection this, that 'tis poſſible for any Mortal Man to expreſs, to lay down his Life for the Brethren: But yet infinitely ſhort of that, which the Son of God expreſſed upon the Croſs, for his <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:</hi> In this he commended his Love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, above all proportion and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, in that <hi>while we were yet Sinners Chriſt died for us, the Juſt for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt.</hi> It is
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:48910:115"/>
thirdly, a foederal Solemnity, whereby we renew the Covenant we entred into at our Baptiſm, Vowing, Promiſing, and Engaging over the Symbols of Chriſt's Body and Blood; and Swearing, as it were, with our Hands laid upon the Redeemer of our Souls, that we will henceforth walk in Newneſs of Life. And what doth <hi>this</hi> mean, but to bind us with the moſt So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Securities, and under the moſt dreadful Penalties, to renounce the Devil and all his Works; to deny all the Luſts of the Fleſh, ſo as not to follow or be led by them; and not only to offer up our Hearts and Spirits unto the God of Purity, but to preſent even our Bodies a living Sacrifice, Holy and Acceptable to him? And for the farthering of all theſe Noble Ends, this Myſtery is, in the Fourth place, the very Means of Grace and Salvation, an Inſtrument that conveys to us the preſent Poſſeſſion of all neceſſary and ſuitable Aſſiſtances, and a Title under Seal to all the Evangelical Promiſes, and particularly to this, that he that perſevereth unto the end, the ſame ſhall <hi>be ſaved;</hi> and that to them who by patient continuance in well-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſeek for Glory and Honour, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, God will render Eternal Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 7. And what doth <hi>this</hi> mean
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:48910:115"/>
too, but that we ſhould grow in Grace; that we muſt not grieve the good Spirit of God, whereby we are Sealed to the day of Redemption; but that we ſhould be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his Might, and give all manner of diligence to make our Calling and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction unto Grace ſure and effectual, by adding to our Faith, Virtue (or Courage) and to Virtue, Knowledge; and to Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Temperance; and to Temperance, Patience; and to Patience, Godlineſs; and to Godlineſs, Brotherly Kindneſs; and to Brotherly Kindneſs, Charity; Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in the higheſt degree, to all Mankind, and even to our Enemies? Thus, you ſee, the nature of the Ordinance it ſelf is ſuch, that it is not only highly uſeful for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but of mighty Importance for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; it hath a tendency forward; and it drives at mighty Ends, which our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours are to be employ'd about, after the Celebration of it is over; that we may be more and more <hi>Partakers of the Divine Nature,</hi> and come every day nearer and nearer to the Life of God.</p>
               <p>TO confirm this ſtill, we may obſerve, Secondly, That thoſe very Preparations which are required in order to our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Communicating, do all look the ſame way, and have a direct tendency to the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:48910:116"/>
ſame purpoſe. Thus Faith, or the hearty belief of the truth of our Religion upon thoſe Evidences and Motives it carries with it, is naturally productive of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Obedience to the Precepts of it, throughout the whole courſe of our lives. For as it diſcovers to us the Folly, the Shamefulneſs, and the bitter Fruits of Sin; ſo it ſhews us on the other hand the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of Virtue, and the beauty of Holineſs. It propoſes Chriſt's Yoke as an eaſie thing, eſpecially to ſuch as make a due uſe of the Spirits Aſſiſtance, and accuſtom themſelves to the familiar pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Religion. And though at the firſt entrance upon a Life of Holineſs, there may be many difficulties for us to grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with, Affections to be regulated, evil Habits to be eradicated, Pleaſures and ſecular Advantages to be denied, when they ſtand in competition with our Duty; and though in the progreſs of our life many temptations from within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us are to be reſiſted; many hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and tryals to be expected, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of diſcouragements of ſeveral kinds to be met with before we die; yet we learn from our Religion, that the preſent ſatisfactions which attend a courſe of Virtue are ſo great, and the future Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards which are to crown it, are ſo end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:48910:116"/>
and unſpeakable, that upon weighing the one againſt the other, we cannot but conclude, that neither the Pleaſures nor the Sufferings of this life are worthy, in the leaſt meaſure, to be compared with the Glory which ſhall be revealed. Now if we bring ſuch a Faith as this with us to the Sacrament, if we be ſtrong and ſtabliſh'd in it, this alone will naturally ſerve to defend us as with a Shield <hi>from all Fiery Darts of the Devil;</hi> and to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us puiſſant enough to <hi>overcome the World,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. But to prepare us the better ſtill for an uninterrupted courſe of Virtue, we are moreover to repent us throughly for all our paſt Sins, and to preſent our ſelves before God with new Hearts and new Spirits, which is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired as a Temporary Diſpoſition, to be brought only at this time before the Altar, there to languiſh and die with Vows that are Abortive, and that yield either no Fruits at all, or at leaſt no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Fruits of Repentance: No, this is to be the beginning of a new life, the firſt riſe and ſtarting towards the Race that is ſet before us; and as we run it, our Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance muſt improve and grow, from Shame and Sorrow for Sin, to an Hatred of it; from this Hatred of it, to ſtrong Reſolutions againſt it; and from thoſe
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:48910:117"/>
Reſolutions againſt it, to an utter aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning and forſaking of it, abſtaining not only from all ſorts, but as far as 'tis poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, from all <hi>appearance of evil,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 22. In like manner thoſe Bowels of Mercy and Kindneſs, which we put on at this time, are to entender our Nature for ever, and to produce in us ſuch large and generous Affections, as may extend, not only to our Brethren and Friends, and to the Family of Chriſt, but to the whole Offspring of <hi>Adam;</hi> to whom we are ſo to open our Compaſſions, that ſuch as are within our reach may participate, thoſe of our Bread, thoſe of our Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, all of our good Wiſhes and Prayers, in imitation of that moſt bleſſed Pattern and Idea of Charity, <hi>who went about doing Good,</hi> Heb. 10. 38. Briefly, all other Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Graces, as Humility, Meekneſs, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, Self-denial, Heavenly-mindedneſs, and the like, wherewith our Souls are to be arrayed and adorned at this Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; if we conſider the tendency of them, they are ſo many <hi>initial</hi> Virtues, to be improved and heightned ſtill by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual practice of them; ſo that from Acts they may turn into Diſpoſitions, and from Diſpoſitions may grow into Habits, which will quite change, purifie, and raiſe our Nature, <hi>till we all come in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the</hi>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:48910:117"/>
                  <hi>Faith, and of the Knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect Man, unto the meaſure of the Stature of the fulneſs of Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 13.</p>
               <p>I have the more particularly inſiſted upon this, to ſhew you the neceſſity of your Watchfulneſs and Induſtry after this bleſſed Solemnity is over. You muſt not, by any means, ſit down preſently, as if the work of the Day, and the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of your Souls were quite done. You muſt ever bear it in your minds, that Chriſtianity requires a <hi>life of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue:</hi> You muſt carry a ſteddy Eye upon the Scope and <hi>Deſign</hi> of our Holy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and employ all your utmoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours in the vigorous purſuit of its noble End. <hi>Brethren</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>I count not my ſelf to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting thoſe things which are behind, and reaching forth unto thoſe things wich are before; I preſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Phil. 3. 13, 14. And, as it follows there, <hi>Let us, as many as be perfect, be thus minded;</hi> ſtill running and ſtretching as hard as we can, towards the end of our Faith and Hope, by an earneſt purſuit of <hi>whatſoever things are true, whatſoever things are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, whatſoever things are juſt, whatſoever things are pure, whatſoever things are love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:48910:118"/>
                  <hi>and whatſoever things are of good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi> Phil. 4. 8. Remember, I beſeech you, that this and other inſtituted Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, though they bring great Peace and Comfort to pious Souls by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Adminiſtration of them, they are ſtill inſtrumental Helps to carry on the main Purpoſe and Will of God, even our <hi>Sanctification.</hi> So that if we do not uſe this Ordinance, as an Inſtrument of improving and perfecting Holineſs, and as a Means purſuant thereunto, whatever Reliſh and Pleaſure it carries with it for the preſent, it will not avail us as to the main.</p>
               <p>FOR the benefits which are conveyed to all well-diſpoſed Hearts by this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are, not only the enlivening Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of Chriſt's Spirit, called Chriſt's <hi>Spiritual Body and Blood,</hi> (becauſe they flow, and are derived from him, as he is the Head of his Church, and the Diſpoſer of all thoſe Bleſſings which are the Fruits of his Interceſſion; (but moreover the Pardon of Sin paſt, and a Title to an happy Reſurrection, and Eternal life to come. Now as the Firſt of theſe, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of Chriſt's Spirit are intended to transform us into the Image of God, and to con-naturalize our Spirits to the Nature of God; ſo are the latter, the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:48910:118"/>
of his pure Love and Goodneſs, whereby he rewards thoſe that reſemble him by a ſimilitude of Nature. I ſpeak now, not of God's general love of <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence,</hi> which moves him to do good to us as we are meerly his Creatures, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard had to our probity, or improbity; in which ſence he is ſaid to have <hi>loved the World,</hi> Joh. 3. 16. But of that particular Love, which Divines call Love of <hi>Friendſhip</hi> and <hi>Complacency,</hi> the formal Object whereof, is <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> or a Rectitude of Nature conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in a great meaſure to his own, as the Pſalmiſt tells us, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 11. 7. <hi>The Righteous Lord loveth Righteouſneſs, his Countenance doth behold the upright.</hi> This is a ray of his own Glory; and the Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence thereof to his own Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections is the true Ground and Reaſon of that <hi>eſpecial</hi> Love he bears to ſome more than he bears to others; becauſe it is impoſſible but he muſt love the Image of himſelf where-ever he finds it, and as impoſſible for him to love any Man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, ſo as to be pleaſed and delighted with the Object: And accordingly, the more or leſs this Image doth reſemble him, the greater or leſs are the Degrees and Meaſures of his Love. The Reaſon therefore of this Love being drawn from
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:48910:119"/>
that Godlike Frame and Diſpoſition of Mind, which is wrought in Men by the gracious Energy of Gods Spirit, and their own kindly compliance with his Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, 'tis a ſenceleſs thing to depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe effects of his Love, which I have now mentioned, <hi>Forgiveneſs of Sin, and a Title to Everlaſting Happineſs;</hi> unleſs we be in ſome meaſure Holy, Juſt, and Good, as the ever-bleſſed God is; theſe being Perfections which he loves, becauſe they are his <hi>own.</hi> Hence it appears, that though we go to the bleſſed Sacrament with Religious and Devout Minds, yet if we go not on to anſwer the great End of Chriſtianity, the bare Reception of it can never be enough to anſwer our own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations; becauſe it is a Relative Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance that looks forward upon a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Life; for the leading whereof, this Myſtery lays all poſſible Obligations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and takes all poſſible Securities at our hands here at the Altar of God.</p>
               <p>THIS being cleared, give me leave now to recommend unto you theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Directions, that you may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this Sacrament, and the Grace of God in vain, but may, in one ſenſe, as the Founder of this Ordinance did in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, <hi>ſee of the Travel of your Souls, and be ſatisfied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:48910:119"/>
1. HAVE a very great care, that you relapſe not into any known and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sins, of which 'tis preſum'd you have repented; and eſpecially beware of ſuch as you have been moſt <hi>apt</hi> and <hi>inclined</hi> to commit. People are ſubject to diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Vices; either by means of their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Conſtitutions, or by means of their different Ages, or by means of their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Opinions, and ſometimes too, by means of their different Callings. For tho' thoſe Callings may be Innocent in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nay commendable in reſpect of their uſe for the publick Good; yet by means of Mens own corrupt Diſpoſitions, they are accidentally apt to betray them to various ſorts of Wickedneſs; ſome to Luxury, ſome to Wantonneſs, ſome to Pride, and moſt to Frauds and Injuſtice; a bitter root of Covetouſneſs ſpreading generally through all Secular Vocations, though it always hurts the Soil, and many times is the Bane of the Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, however it be thought a <hi>thrifty</hi> Vice. <hi>Here then,</hi> every one muſt careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerve which are his <hi>own Iniquities,</hi> the Sins that do ſo <hi>eaſily</hi> beſet him; and accordingly muſt ſtand upon the ſtricteſt Watch, to guard himſelf from all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of relapſing, eſpecially from ſuch dangers as he is moſt ready to fall into
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:48910:120"/>
upon any occaſion. For as the Devil is always moſt buſie about Men when they have been doing their Souls good, to lay his <hi>old</hi> Snares in their way, and, if they fail, to miniſter to them freſh and <hi>new</hi> Temptations; ſo is their yielding to thoſe Temptations, of very miſchievous and deadly <hi>conſequence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 IT is an Act of the higheſt <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fideouſneſs,</hi> to be falſe to thoſe Sacred Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations which we have now taken upon us after the moſt Solemn manner, in the preſence of God and his Holy Angels, and over that broken Body of Chriſt which was given in Sacrifice as well to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate as to deſtroy the works of the Devil. Therefore (ſaith the Preacher) <hi>When thou voweſt a Vow unto God, defer not to pay it, for he hath no pleaſure in Fools; pay that which thou haſt vowed. Better is it that thou ſhouldeſt not vow, than that thou ſhouldeſt vow, and not pay.</hi> Eccleſ. 5. 4, 5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. IT is an Act of inexcuſable Hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and <hi>Preſumption,</hi> to return to thoſe Impieties which have already coſt us ſo dear. Who but a true Penitent can be ſenſible what the Terrours of God are, when he awakens a ſleepy Conſcience? What that Shame is, which tinctures the Forehead at the ſecret remembrance of ones Guilt? What thoſe Dolours are
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:48910:120"/>
which corrode the Heart, like Vipers which gnaw the Womb that bears them? What thoſe throws and Agonies are, which the Soul endures when it comes to be ruffled by the hand of God? And how violent the Pangs and Convulſions of a new Birth are, when ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate Habits come to be torn up out of ones Breaſt by the Roots? Repentance is a moſt painful thing, if it be Genuine and Hearty, when a poor Wretch is a recovering out of that miſerable State, wherein a long courſe and trade of Wickedneſs hath plunged him; and I think 'tis <hi>Oecumenius</hi> that hath ſomewhere obſerved, <hi>that 'tis no eaſie matter to fall back again into ſuch a courſe of Life, as hath once put one to ſo much expence of Shame, Sorrow, and Vexation.</hi> The ſenſe and experience of ſmart, is naturally apt to make Men very fearful of being wounded any more: So that when they relapſe into a wicked State with ſo much Facility, it is a certain Sign, that either their ſmart was not pungent and acute e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, or elſe that they are of very har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and deſperate Spirits, that can break through all the Pricks and Twinges of Conſcience to ruſh upon the Pikes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:48910:121"/>
3. IT is the ready way to loſe all the Profit of Repentance, though it were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo chargeable and coſtly. Therefore is Apoſtacy compared to the moſt odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and filthy Spectacle; to <hi>a Dog's lick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his Vomit, and to the wallowing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain of a Sow in the mire,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 22. Nor can it be, but ſuch Creatures muſt needs appear abominable in the ſight of God, becauſe his Love and Hatred ſtill go along with the Reaſons of them; which are never grounded upon any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality towards Mens Perſons, but upon a juſt view of their Qualifications and Tempers; ſo that as theſe vary from better to worſe, and from Purity turn to Corruption, ſo they become inſtead of Objects of Gods Love, the Objects of his Hatred, which always runs out in a direct courſe againſt all Impiety, and ſtill follows it at the heels: and hence is the terrible Menace in the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel, When the Righteous Man turneth away from his Righteouſneſs, and committeth In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity, and doth according to all the Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations that the Wicked Man doth, ſhall he live? All his Righteouſneſs that he hath done ſhall not be mentioned: in his Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs that he hath Treſpaſſed, and in his Sin that he hath ſinned, in them ſhall he die,</hi> Ezek. 18. 24. This is not only one
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:48910:121"/>
of God's immutable Decrees, but more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the natural Reſult of Relapſes, from the common method and courſe of Things; eſpecially when a Man's Relapſes are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, habitual, and <hi>laſting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. FOR that which is further conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, is, That the Recovery of ſuch Men is very difficult and uncertain. St. <hi>Peter,</hi> ſpeaking of ſome miſerable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, who, though they had been clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from their Heathen Sins, upon their Embracing of Chriſtianity, fell back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into that wretched State out of which they had been delivered, ſaith, That <hi>ſince after they had eſcaped the Pollutions of the World through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, they were again intangled therein and overcome, the latter end is worſe with them than the beginning;</hi> and that <hi>it had been better for them not to have known the way of Righteouſneſs, than after they had known it, to have turned aſide from the holy Commandment delivered unto them,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 20, 21. I confeſs, he ſpeaks there of their Apoſtacy from Chriſt's Religion to thoſe abominable Impurities which they had cuſtomarily practis'd while they were yet Pagans; which was Wickedneſs in the higheſt degree, far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond any Vice, I hope, that hath been acted by any who have been at the Lord's
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:48910:122"/>
Table. But yet the thing is in a very great meaſure applicable to thoſe, who having devoted themſelves to God by this Federal Myſtery, take the confidence af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to let themſelves looſe again to their Enormities, wherewith they had polluted their Souls and Conſciences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The laſt State of thoſe Men muſt needs be worſe than the firſt; and that according to the <hi>Nature</hi> of the thing it ſelf. For hereby Vice becomes familiar with them: It loſeth that ugly and ghaſtly Aſpect, which at firſt makes it appear very ſhameful and frightful; their Acquaintance with it makes it the more friendly and free, like ones converſing with the Devil, that by degrees wears off that Horror, which is ready to ſtrike another through at the very Thoughts of his Appearing. There is naturally ſuch Turpitude in Wickedneſs, and ſo contrary it is to our Reaſon and true Intereſt, that an innocent Perſon, when ſolicited to it, is apt to be ſtartled at the firſt Motion; and if he be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to act it, he cannot but feel great Remorſe and Anguiſh in his Mind after the Commiſſion. But Cuſtom and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity directly tends not only to remove that Fear and Shame, which was once ſuch Guards to the Mind, but moreover
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:48910:122"/>
to make the Conſcience hard and cruſty; like Fleſh ſeared with an hot Iron, ſo that it loſeth the faculty of Senſation. And when a Man is come to ſuch a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed paſs, it is as impoſſible for him to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and come to himſelf again, without the mighty Aſſiſtance of God's Spirit, as it is to live, and move, and breathe in a Grave. And what Reaſon and Grounds are there to expect that <hi>extraordinary</hi> Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, after ſuch monſtrous Provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons given, notwithſtanding the ſtricteſt Ties and Engagements to the contrary? We read in Scripture, of <hi>Reſiſting,</hi> of <hi>Grieving,</hi> and of <hi>Quenching</hi> the Spirit. Nor is it poſſible for thoſe, who were once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned at the other Sacrament, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards at this have taſted of the <hi>heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gift,</hi> and been made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, and have taſted the good Word of God, and the Powers of the World to come<hi>:</hi> 'Tis not <hi>poſſible,</hi> I ſay, for ſuch to fall of to a vitious Courſe of Life, but by contumeliouſly intreating the Spirit of Grace, by offering great Violence againſt his ſtrivings, by ſpoiling his holy Workmanſhip, and by bringing to nought thoſe Virtues and Perfections of Nature, which were the Reſults and Effects of his Divine Operation. And what is all this, but the next way to
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:48910:123"/>
ſtifle and put an end to all his Motions, and to force him utterly to depart? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe Hoſtilities thus acted againſt the clear Light of Reaſon, and the loud Clamours of Conſcience, cannot proceed from any other cauſe, but from Wills that are obſtinately ſet upon Evil, and from Affections that are deſperately in love with that which neceſſarily leadeth to Deſtruction. For it is to be ſuppoſed, that whoever comes to this tremendous Myſtery, muſt, if he comes with ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Heart, carry with him theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, That the Religion he profeſſeth is of God; That Chriſt ſealed it upon the Croſs with that Blood, whereof there is a Repreſentation in this Myſtery; That the Covenant between God and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is immutable; That eternal Life therein promiſed is to be choſen before the whole World; That a Life of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity is the certain way to it; That Virtue is Eligible of it ſelf, and for the Peace and Satisfaction it rewards them with in this Life, beyond the groſs and tranſient Pleaſures of the Fleſh; and that it is the extreameſt Folly for a Man to chuſe thoſe Courſes which bring a kind of Hell to him, before he arrives at that which burns with Fire and Brimeſtone. There is no underſtanding and ſerious
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:48910:123"/>
Perſon, but muſt grant all this and more: And therefore to Relapſe into a State of Wickedneſs, after ſo many Vows, after ſo many Convictions, and conſequently after ſo many Reluctancies and Struglings of Conſcience, can proceed from no other Cauſe but the ſtrong Malignity of a <hi>carnal Mind, which is perfect enmity againſt God,</hi> utterly inconſiſtent with the things of the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>THESE are the Reproaches and Dangers of Relapſing into a wicked State of Life, after the reception of this Sacrament; and ſhould a Man die in ſuch a wretched Condition, I tremble to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what an endleſs State of Miſery he muſt drop into next, becauſe (as I have already ſhew'd) nothing but entire Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity of Mind, and a vertuous Temper, can capacitate or diſpoſe us for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the Saints in Light. I do not now ſpeak of Sins of Ignorance, of Inadvertency, of Infirmity, and humane Weakneſs. For as there is no poſſible ſufficient Fence againſt them, ſo there is no ſtrict Obligations upon us to keep our ſelves free entirely from them; nor are theſe the Sins which the Word of God cries out upon ſo, as to threaten them with eternal Death, or with the Derelicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Chriſt's Spirit. No; it is ſinning
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:48910:124"/>
with an high hand, and againſt an Honeſt Conſcience; and againſt Stipulations and Promiſes which were in our Power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; this is that preſumptuous acting, which lays Men naked and deſtitute of the Grace of God in this Life, and leaves them expoſed to God's everlaſting Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure in the next.</p>
               <p>YOU have therefore great need, as ſoon as this Solemnity is over, as to bow your Knees to the Father of Lights, from whom every good and perfect Gift cometh, that he would now hold up your goings in his Paths, that your Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps may not ſlide; ſo to be very cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect and diligent your ſelves, <hi>to make ſtreight Paths for your feet</hi> (as the Author to the Hebrews ſpeaks) <hi>leſt any Man ſhould fail of the Grace of God;</hi> leſt any Man ſhould turn Fornicator or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Perſon, as <hi>Eſau, Who for one morſel of bread ſold his birthright.</hi> For ye know, how that afterward, when he would have inherited the Bleſſing, he was rejected; for <hi>he found no place of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> (no way of changing his Father's mind) <hi>though he ſought it earneſtly with tears,</hi> Heb. 12.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIII. <hi>Of Perſeverance.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I HAVE diſcourſed againſt Relapſing into a ſinful courſe, not as if it were ſufficient for us to forbear going back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or to ſtand at a ſtay, but becauſe in order to our progreſs in Virtue, it is the firſt thing neceſſary, to ſtand upon your Legs, and to be in a moving and walking poſture.</p>
               <p>2. THE ſecond thing therefore we are to be careful of, is, to remember the Promiſes and Reſolutions we have made, and to purſue them ſo as to tranſmit them into a <hi>ſettled Practice</hi> of all manner of Virtue. This Direction conſiſts of ſeveral Branches.</p>
               <p n="1">1. WE are to keep our Vows of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment as <hi>freſh</hi> in our Memories as 'tis poſſible. For the Underſtanding being the original Principle of Action, which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns the Lower Faculties of the Soul, according to thoſe Idea's and Notions that it works by it ſelf, it is impoſſible to act with any certain regularity, when a Man doth not <hi>Apprehend,</hi> or doth not <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> what he is to do. Notions that are
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:48910:125"/>
quite loſt have no more Power and Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon us, than if we had never enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them: And this is one great cauſe of the Decay of Religion, that Men do not ſufficiently charge their Duty upon their Memories, nor revolve their Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations in their Minds as they ſhould do, but lay aſide the thoughts of their former <hi>Engagements,</hi> like thoſe unfruitful Hearers St. <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of, who though they find by the Precepts of Chriſt how Undefiled and Pure their whole Man ſhould be; yet inconſiderately drop all care of cleanſing themſelves from their Pollutions, as thoſe <hi>who behold their natural face in a glaſs,</hi> and then go their ways, ſtreightway <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting what manner of Men they were;</hi> that is, what Spots there are in their Faces which are neceſſary to be wiped off, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 23, 24. when the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe Reſolutions we made at the Lord's Table, doth ſlide ſo ſoon out of the mind, it is impoſſible to conceive how they ſhould bring any Fruit unto Perfection, though many were ſerious and ſtrong for the time, becauſe they are not rooted enough in the Heart to ſpring up, like Corn caſt into the Boſom of a <hi>Kindly</hi> Soyl, but are loſt preſently for want of deep digeſtion, like Seed ſcatter'd by the way ſide, upon ſtony ground, which
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:48910:125"/>
lies a little, to be picked up by the next Bird that comes. Due Conſideration is very powerful to Invigorate the Faculties of the Soul, and to make them productive of a New Life; becauſe it keeps the mind in ſuch a conſtant motion as maintains the whole Soul at its daily Work. Be ſure therefore often to renew the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of thoſe Vows, which you made to God at this Covenant-Feaſt; conſider and meditate upon them every day, as you ſhould upon your Latter End; or, that I may allude to <hi>Moſes</hi> in another caſe, <hi>Lay up thoſe Vows in your heart, and in your ſoul, and bind them for a ſign upon your hand, that they may be as Phylacteries before your eyes; and think of them when you ſit in your Houſes, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you riſe up,</hi> Deut. 11. 18, 19.</p>
               <p n="2">2. THE <hi>next</hi> buſineſs is, to tranſmit them into <hi>Practice.</hi> For neither are lazy Wiſhes to any purpoſe; nor can feeble Reſolutions or faint Endeavours ever anſwer the great Ends of Chriſtianity. As Virtue is acquired by ſingle Acts, ſo is it Improved by repeated exerciſe, and Perfected by the aſſiduous Diſcipline of Perſeverance. 'Tis a miſtake to think, that Chriſt's Spirit works after ſuch a Phyſical Manner, as to Transform a Man
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:48910:126"/>
perfectly in a <hi>moment,</hi> or to make him compleatly Religious all at once, by a ſudden and uncontroulable <hi>Infuſion</hi> of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual Holineſs. His Operations are ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive; alluring, ſtirring, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Men to perfect Holineſs in the fear of God gradually; and by helping them to Rectifie and Refine Humane Nature more and more, juſt as <hi>evil</hi> Cuſtom helps to <hi>deprave</hi> it. Therefore the <hi>Practice</hi> of Virtue is abſolutely neceſſary, becauſe it cannot be thought how the frequent Luſts of the Fleſh can otherwiſe be mortified, or how a crooked Diſpoſition can other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be Reformed and ſtreightned; or how inveterate Habits can otherwiſe be eradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the full.</p>
               <p n="3">3. THIS, Thirdly, muſt be a <hi>ſetled</hi> Practice, a State, a Tenour, a <hi>Life</hi> of Virtue. To reſolve one Day upon a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Progreſs, and then to let thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions go off with ones firſt Sleep, is but a parting with ones Sins in a kind of pet, like the parting of Lovers, whom the next opportunity reconciles. Many things may provoke People to fall out with their Luſts for a while; either the penetrating faculty of the Word of God; or a ſudden and ſurpriſing proſpect of Hell; or the ſnubbings and laſhes of a reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Mind; or ſome outward Calamity
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:48910:126"/>
that reneweth the ſmart of an old Sore, and revives the ſenſe of former Guilt, as the Impriſonment of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Sons in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> brought it into their freſh remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance how guilty they had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cering their Brother, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. Nor do I deny, but ſuch Paſſions are ſometimes preparatory to a true Repentance, if right reaſon ſteps in before the fit be over, and obtains full Liberty of Audience. But if theſe motions of the Soul do not ſettle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a compoſed <hi>State</hi> of Virtue, but are only Temporary and Tranſient things, like <hi>a Morning Cloud, and the early Dew that goeth away,</hi> to uſe the Prophet's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6. 4. They cannot profit as to the main, becauſe they fall ſhort of the <hi>Ends</hi> of our Religion, being not effectually perfective of our Natures.</p>
               <p n="4">4. FOR, Fourthly, our Reſolutions ſhould paſs into the practice of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> Holineſs. The Perfection of God himſelf conſiſts in the Infinite Glory and Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his Nature, that he is moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly Wiſe, Juſt, Good, Pure, True, and the like; and that there is ſuch an entire Harmony within himſelf, that there cannot be the leaſt Aberration or Declenſion of his Will from the Infinite Reaſon of his Mind; but that in all his Actions his Power is conducted by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:48910:127"/>
that are ſuitable to his own Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; that is, by reaſons that are perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Juſt and Good. And upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it is, that he is perfectly happy in himſelf, becauſe he hath the Poſſeſſion and Enjoyment of the moſt Excellent and Infinite Good. Now this ſhews, that as our Happineſs doth conſiſt in our draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near unto God, by a Rectitude, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Purity of Nature, as far as it is conſiſtent with our Finite and Mortal condition; ſo our Perfection doth conſiſt in an <hi>entire</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> Conformity of our Wills and Affections to <hi>His,</hi> when we chuſe and refuſe, Love and Hate in every Particular, juſt as he commands us. This, I ſay, is our <hi>Perfection;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, hereby we are conducted as he himſelf is, by the Infinite Reaſon of his Mind; only, indeed, we are Govern'd by it at <hi>Second</hi> Hand<hi>:</hi> For as <hi>His</hi> Will goes along by the preſcriptions of his own <hi>Reaſon,</hi> which is the Law of all his Actions; ſo we go along by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of his <hi>Will;</hi> and then we are perfect as God is; I mean ſtill, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the capacities of Humane Nature. It is neceſſary therefore, that our Practice of Virtue be <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niform,</hi> or that we habitually live according to the <hi>whole</hi> Will of God; becauſe where we
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:48910:127"/>
come ſhort of this <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity,</hi> there we come ſhort of that <hi>Perfection,</hi> and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, of that Happineſs, which is the great ſcope and deſign of Chriſtianity. This is the meaning of Divines, when they tell us, that there muſt be in us a Perfection of <hi>Parts,</hi> though we are not capable of a perfection of <hi>Degrees;</hi> that is, there muſt be the preſence of every Virtue, though there be at the ſame time ſuch a mixture of Corruption with our nobleſt Endowments, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not exerciſe them in that high pitch as we ſhall do in the next Life, when we ſhall be <hi>of perfect Stature;</hi> even as a Child in the Womb hath all the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Parts and Lineaments of a Man, though it will be long before he comes to a full Growth and Proportion.</p>
               <p>CONSIDER then, I beſeech you, and you eſpecially who have been Partakers of the Bleſſed Viands of Immortality, what ſtrict Obligations ye have entred into, and what manner of Perſons ye ought to be <hi>in all Holy Converſation and Godlineſs.</hi> You are now to fulfil all Righteouſneſs; you are now to deny all Ungodlineſs and Worldly Luſts; you are now to do, as the Combatants in the old Olympick Games, to lay aſide every weight that might oppreſs, and every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrance
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:48910:128"/>
that might intangle you, and to run with Perſeverence the race that is ſet before you; and you are to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, what the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, is become guilty of all;</hi> that is, Guilty of Diſobedience, and Obnoxious to Puniſhment, as well as if he had violated all.</p>
               <p>THAT you may not miſcarry there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, through the Wilful neglect of any neceſſary Duty, or by the preſumptuous Commiſſion of any heinous Sin, lay daily before your Eyes the perfect Law of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, which our Bleſſed Saviour and his Apoſtles have left us as the Infallible Rule of a perfectly <hi>Chriſtian Life.</hi> And for your more eaſie performance, I ſhall now briefly repreſent to you a <hi>Scheme</hi> and <hi>Platform</hi> of Virtue, agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to thoſe Precepts which are ſcatter'd up and down in the Holy Scriptures, as a very fit and proper Undertaking, to come at the cloſe of this whole Subject.</p>
               <p>I begin with that which is the ſource and Principle of our Actions, whether they be good or evil, the <hi>inner</hi> Man. <hi>Keep thy Heart with all diligence; for out of it are the Iſſues of Life,</hi> Prov. 4. 25. <hi>As a good Man cut of the good Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Heart, bringeth forth good</hi>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:48910:128"/>
                  <hi>things, ſo an evil Man out of the evil Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure bringeth forth evil things,</hi> Matth. 12. 35. <hi>For out of the Heart proceed evil Deſigns, Murders, Adulteries, Fornications, Thefts, falſe Witneſs, Blaſphemies,</hi> Mat. 15. 19. <hi>It is a good thing therefore, that</hi> (principally in this ſenſe) <hi>the Heart be eſtabliſhed with Grace,</hi> Heb. 13. 9. <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in Heart, for they ſhall ſee God,</hi> Matth. 5. 8.</p>
               <p>THE good things which come out of this hidden Treaſure are uſually di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into three general kinds, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath reckoned them, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, Righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>Godlineſs:</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which three Heads are comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the ſeveral Duties which relate to our ſelves, and to our Neighbours, and to God himſelf. According to which Diviſion, I ſhall proceed:</p>
               <p>FIRST, to lay before you thoſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which more immediately relate to your ſelves in a ſeparate and Perſonal capacity, as I find them propoſed in the Holy Scriptures.</p>
               <p>LEARN of Chriſt in the very firſt place, to be <hi>lowly in Heart,</hi> Mat. 11. 29. <hi>God hath reſpect unto the lowly,</hi> Pſ. 138. 6. <hi>He giveth Grace unto the lowly,</hi> Prov. 3. 34. <hi>Be ye therefore cloathed with Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 5. <hi>Let this mind be in</hi>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:48910:129"/>
                  <hi>you, which was alſo in Chriſt Jeſus; who being in the form of God, thought it no Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery to be equal with God, but made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of no Reputation, and took upon him the form of a Servant, and was made in the likeneſs of Men; and being found in Faſhion as a Man, he humbled himſelf and became Obedient unto Death, even the death of the Croſs,</hi> Phil. 2. 5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>That no one of you be puffed up,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 6. <hi>That ye be not high minded, but fear,</hi> Rom. 11. 20. <hi>That ye mind not high things, but condeſcend to Men of low Eſtate,</hi> Rom. 12. 16. <hi>That ye think not of your ſelves more highly than ye ought to think, but think ſoberly, according as God hath dealt to every Man the Meaſure of Faith,</hi> Rom. 12. 3. <hi>And that ye truſt not in uncertain Riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy,</hi> 1 Tim 6. 17.</p>
               <p>NEXT of Kin to this Virtue of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility</hi> is that of <hi>Meekneſs;</hi> ſuch a Beauty of the Mind, that it is called the <hi>Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of a meek and a quiet Spirit, which even in the ſight of God is <hi>of great Price,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 4. To recommend it unto us, God requires us to be (as he himſelf is) ſlow to wrath, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 19. To ceaſe from Anger, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 37. 8. Not to be angry without a cauſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 22. Nor to be angry in ſuch a meaſure as to Sin; or to
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:48910:129"/>
let the Sun go down upon our Wrath, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 26. But to put on Bowels of Mercy, Kindneſs, Meekneſs, Long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 12. And to let all Bitterneſs, and Wrath, and Anger, and Clamour, and Evil-ſpeaking, be put away from us, with all Malice, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 31.</p>
               <p>THESE two Virtues being deeply ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated, <note place="margin">Patience.</note> will naturally produce in us great Temper and Firmneſs of Mind in any grievous Circumſtances. God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, though he be provoked every day, is long-ſuffering towards us. The Bleſſed Jeſus endured all the Contradictions of Sinners againſt himſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 3. And when he ſuffered, he threatned not; but committed himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 23. And all this, to leave us an Example that we ſhould follow his Steps, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 21. That we ſhould poſſeſs our Souls in Patience, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. 19. That we be patient in Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 12. That we endure Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 5. That we endure to the End, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 13. And when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fiery Tryal comes, that we ſhould not wonder, or be troubled, as if ſome ſtrange thing hapned; but rejoyce, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as we are partakers of Chriſt's Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; that when his Glory ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:48910:130"/>
we may be glad alſo with exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Joy, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 12, 13.</p>
               <p>THIS leads on the ſlighting of all <note place="margin">Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> things here below, when they ſtand in competition with the love of God and a good Conſcience. <hi>Love not the World, neither the things that are in the World; if any Man love the World, the love of the Father is not in him,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 15. Therefore, let your Converſation be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Covetouſneſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5. Lay not for your ſelves Treaſures upon Earth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 19. If Riches encreaſe, ſet not your Heart upon them, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 62. 10. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther take any (anxious) thought for your life, what ye ſhall eat, or what ye ſhall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye ſhall put on, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 25. But uſe this World, as thoſe that uſe it not, for the Faſhion of this World paſſeth away, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 31.</p>
               <p>INSTEAD of this, ſet your Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Heavenly-Minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> on things above, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 2. Seek ye firſt the Kingdom of God, and his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 33. Let your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation be in Heaven, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 20. Walk worthy of the Vocation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ye are called; and put off, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the former Converſation, the old Man which is corrupt according to the deceitful Luſts; and be renewed
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:48910:130"/>
in the Spirit of your mind, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 22, 23. For to be carnally minded, is Death; but to be Spiritually minded, is Life and Peace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 6.</p>
               <p>FROM this Heavenly-mindedneſs, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally <note place="margin">Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> ſprings another great Duty; <hi>viz.</hi> to be ſatisfied with ſuch a ſhare and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this World, as it ſhall pleaſe God to diſpenſe to us; to be pleaſed with ſuch things as we have, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5. And with that Food which God ſhall judge convenient for us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 8. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Food and Raiment therewith to be content, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 8.</p>
               <p>WHOSOEVER will come after me, <note place="margin">Self-deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</note> let him deny himſelf, ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Mark.</hi> 8. 34. And theſe are neceſſary Acts of Self-denial; to caſt down Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and every thing that exalteth it ſelf againſt the Knowledge of God, and to bring into Captivity every thought to the Obedience of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 5.

Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy mind.
